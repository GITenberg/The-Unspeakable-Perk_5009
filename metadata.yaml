description: The unspeakable perk strode down his path, broke into a trot, and held
  to it until he reached his house. But Miss Polly, departing in her own direction,
  stopped dead after ten minutes' going. It had struck her forcefully that she had
  forgotten the matter of the expense of the message. How could she reach him? She
  remembered the cliff above the rock, and the signal. If a signal was valid in one
  direction, it ought to work equally well in the other. She had her automatic with
  her. Retracing her steps, she ascended the cliff, a rugged climb. Across the deep-fringed
  chasm she could plainly see the porch of the quinta with the little clearing at
  the side, dim in the clouded light. Drawing the revolver, she fired three shots.
