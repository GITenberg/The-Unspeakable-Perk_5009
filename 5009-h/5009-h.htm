    <h2>
      I. &mdash; MR. BEETLE MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man sat in a niche of the mountain, busily hating the Caribbean Sea.
      It was quite a contract that he had undertaken, for there was a large
      expanse of Caribbean Sea in sight to hate; very blue, and still, and
      indifferent to human emotions. However, the young man was a good steadfast
      hater, and he came there every day to sit in the shade of the overhanging
      boulder, where there was a little trickle of cool air down the slope and a
      little trickle of cool water from a crevice beneath the rock, to despise
      that placid, unimpressionable ocean and all its works and to wish that it
      would dry up forthwith, so that he might walk back to the blessed United
      States of America. In good plain American, the young man was pretty
      homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-man's-lengths up the mountain, on the crest of the sturdy hater's
      rock, the girl sat, loving the Caribbean Sea. Hers, also, was a large
      contract, and she was much newer to it than was the man to his, for she
      had only just discovered this vantage-ground by turning accidentally into
      a side trail&mdash;quite a private little side trail made by her
      unsuspected neighbor below&mdash;whence one emerges from a sea of verdure
      into full view of the sea of azure. For the time, she was content to rest
      there in the flow of the breeze and feast her eyes on that broad, unending
      blue which blessedly separated her from the United States of America and
      certain perplexities and complications comprised therein. Presently she
      would resume the trail and return to the city of Caracuna, somewhere
      behind her. That is, she would if she could find it, which was by no means
      certain. Not that she greatly cared. If she were really lost, they'd come
      out and get her. Meantime, all she wished was to rest mind and body in the
      contemplation of that restful plain of cool sapphire, four thousand feet
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a spirit of mischief abroad upon that mountain slope. It
      embodied itself in a puff of wind that stirred gratefully the curls above
      the girl's brow. Also, it fanned the neck of the watcher below and
      cunningly moved his hat from his side; not more than a few feet, indeed,
      but still far enough to transfer it from the shade into the glaring sun
      and into the view of the girl above. The owner made no move. If the wind
      wanted to blow his new panama into some lower treetop, compelling him to
      throw stones, perhaps to its permanent damage, in order to dislodge it,
      why, that was just one more cause of offense to pin to his indictment of
      irritation against the great island republic of Caracuna. Such is the
      temper one gets into after a year in the tropics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like as peas are panama hats to the eyes of the inexpert; far more like
      than men who live under them. For the girl, it was a direct inference that
      this was a hat which she knew intimately; which, indeed, she had rather
      maliciously eluded, riot half an hour before. Therefore, she addressed it
      familiarly: "Boo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this simple monosyllable exceeded her fondest expectations.
      There was a sharp exclamation of surprise, followed by a cry that might
      have meant dismay or wrath or both, as something metallic tinkled and
      slid, presently coming to a stop beside the hat, where it revealed itself
      as a pair of enormous, aluminum-mounted brown-green spectacles. After it,
      on all fours, scrambled the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shock number one: It wasn't the man at all! Instead of the black-haired,
      flanneled, slender Adonis whom the trouble-maker confidently assumed to
      have been under that hat, she beheld a brownish-clad, stocky figure with a
      very blond head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shock number two: The figure was groping lamentably and blindly in the
      undergrowth, and when, for an instant, the face was turned half toward
      her, she saw that the eyes were squinted tight-closed, with a painful
      extreme of muscular tension about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently one of the ranging hands encountered the spectacles, and settled
      upon them. With careful touches, it felt them all over. A mild grunt,
      presumably of satisfaction, made itself heard, and the figure got to its
      feet. But before the face turned again, the girl had stepped back, out of
      range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence, above and below; a silence the long persistence of which came
      near to constituting shock number three. What sort of hermit had she
      intruded upon? Into what manner of remote Brahministic contemplation had
      she injected that impertinent "Boo!"? Who, what, how, why&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say it again." The request came from under the rock. Evidently the
      spectacled owner had resumed his original situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say WHAT again?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything," returned the voice, with child-like content.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I&mdash;I hope you didn't break your glasses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      On consideration, she decided to ignore this prompt countering of the
      pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were some one else," she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, so I am, am I not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one else than you thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, I suppose&mdash;But I meant some one else besides yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only wish I were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she asked, intrigued by the fervid inflection of the wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because then I'd be somewhere else than in this infernal hell-hole of a
      black-and-tan nursery of revolution, fever, and trouble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it one of the loveliest spots I've ever seen," said she loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On this rock? Perhaps five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on the rock. In Caracuna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite a long time. Nearly a fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The commentary on this was so indefinite that she was moved to inquire:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a local dialect you're speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that was a grunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it was a very polite grunt, even as grunts go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not. I'm afraid I'm out of the habit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of grunting? You seem expert enough to satisfy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; of being polite. I'll apologize if&mdash;if you'll only go on
      talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or laughing," he amended promptly. "Do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One can't laugh to order!" she protested; "or even talk to order. But why
      do you stay 'way out here in the mountains if you're so eager to hear the
      human voice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The human voice be&mdash;choked! It's YOUR human voice I want to hear&mdash;your
      kind of human voice, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that my kind of human voice is particularly different from
      plenty of other human voices," she observed, with an effect of fine
      impartial judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's widely different from the kind that afflicts the suffering ear in
      this part of the world. Fourteen months ago I heard the last American girl
      speak the last American-girl language that's come within reach of me. Oh,
      no,&mdash;there WAS one, since, but she rasped like a rheumatic phonograph
      and had brick-colored freckles. Have you got brick-colored freckles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand up and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, SIR!&mdash;that is, ma'am. Too much risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Risk! Of what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freckles. I don't like freckles. Not on YOUR voice, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my VOICE? Are you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I am&mdash;a little. Any one is who stays down here more than a
      year. But that about the voice and the freckles was sane enough. What I'm
      trying to say&mdash;and you might know it without a diagram&mdash;is that,
      from your voice, you ought to be all that a man dreams of when&mdash;well,
      when he hasn't seen a real American girl for an eternity. Now I can sit
      here and dream of you as the loveliest princess that ever came and went
      and left a memory of gold and blue in the heart of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not gold and blue!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you're not. But your speech is. I'll be wise, and content
      myself with that. One look might pull down, In irrevocable ruin, all the
      lovely fabric of my dream. By the way, are you a Cookie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A WHAT?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cookie. Tourist. No, of course you're not. No tour would be imbecile
      enough to touch here. The question is: How did you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, rather, are you here at all? Perhaps you're just a figment of the
      overstrained ear. And if I undertook to look, there wouldn't be anything
      there at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you don't believe in me, I'll fly away on a sunbeam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please! Don't say that! I'm doing my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      So panic-stricken was the appeal that she laughed again, in spite of
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's better! Now, come, be honest with me. You're not pretty, are
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? I'm as lovely as the dawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far, so good. And have you got long golden&mdash;that is to say,
      silken hair that floats almost to your knees?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," she replied, with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it plentiful enough so that you could spare a little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you asking me for a lock of my hair?" she queried, on a note of
      mirth. "For a stranger, you go fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; oh, no!" he protested. "Nothing so familiar. I'm offering you a bribe
      for conversation at the price of, say, five hairs, if you can sacrifice so
      many."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds delightfully like voodoo," she observed. "What must I do with
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, catch your hair. Well up toward the head, please. Now pull it out.
      One, two, three&mdash;yank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ouch!" said the voice above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do it again. Now have you got two?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knot them together."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a period of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very difficult," complained the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you're doing it in silence. There must be sprightly conversation
      or the charm won't work. Talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me who you thought I was when you said, 'Boo!' at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A goose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A&mdash;a GOOSE! Why&mdash;what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't one proverbially say 'Boo!' to a goose?" she remarked demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If one has the courage. Now, I haven't. I'm shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shy! You?" Again the delicious trill of her mirth rang in his ears. "I
      should imagine that to be the least of your troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Truly." There was real and anxious earnestness in his assurance.
      "It's because I don't see you. If I were face to face with you, I'd
      stammer and get red and make a regular imbecile of myself. Another reason
      why I stick down here and decline to yield to temptation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O wise young man! ARE you young? Ouch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reasonably. Was that the last hair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively! I'm scalped. You're a red Indian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tie it on. Now, fasten a hairpin on the end and let it down. All right.
      I've got it. Wait!" The fragile line of communication twitched for a
      moment. "Haul, now. Gently!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came the thread, and, as its burden rose over the face of the rock, the
      girl gave a little cry of delight:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How exquisite! Orchids, aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the golden-brown bee orchid. Just your coloring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is. How do you know?" she asked, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the hair. And your eyes have gold flashes in the brown when the sun
      touches them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wits are YOUR eyes. But where do you get such orchids?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From my little private garden underneath the rock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life will be a dull and dreary round unless I see that garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I say! Wait! Really, now, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;" There was panic in
      the protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't be afraid. I'm only playing with your fears. One look at you as
      you chased your absurd spectacles was enough to satisfy my curiosity. Go
      in peace, startled fawn that you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go nothing! I'm not going. Neither are you, I hope, until you've told me
      lots more about yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that for a spray of orchids?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are quite rare ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl mused, and a sudden impulse seized her to take the unseen
      acquaintance at his word and free her mind as she had not been able to do
      to any living soul for long weeks. She pondered over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You aren't getting ready to go?" he cried, alarmed at her long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I'm thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please think aloud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking&mdash;suppose I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much of weighty consideration in her accents that the other
      fear again beset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did what? Not come down from the rock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be calm. I shouldn't want to face you any more than you want to face me,
      if I decided to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," he encouraged. "It sounds most promising."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than that. It's fairly thrilling. It's the awful secret of my life
      that I'm considering laying bare to you, just like a dime novel. Are you
      discreet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the eternal rocks. Prescribe any form of oath and I'll take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm feeling just irresponsible enough to venture. Now, if I knew you, of
      course I couldn't. But as I shall never set eyes on you again&mdash;I
      never shall, shall I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless you creep up on me unawares."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll unburden my overweighted heart, and you can be my augur and
      advise me with supernatural wisdom. Are you up to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. But, remember: this means truly that we are never to meet. And if
      you ever do meet me and recognize my voice, you must go away at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed," he said cheerfully, just a bit too cheerfully to be flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. I'm a runaway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally. Where's home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Utica, New York," she specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "U.S.A.," he concluded, with a sigh. "What did you run away from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does any one ever run away from anything else?" he inquired
      philosophically. "What particular brand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three men," she said dolorously. "All after poor little me. They all
      thought I ought to marry them, and everybody else seemed to think so, too&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go slow! Did you say Utica or Utah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody thought I ought to marry one or the other of 'em, I mean. If I
      could have married them all, now, it might have been easier, for I like
      them ever so much. But how could I make up my mind? So I just seized papa
      around the neck and ran away with him down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why here, of all places on earth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's interested in some mines and concessions and things. It's very
      beautiful, but I almost wish I'd stayed at home and married Bobby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is Bobby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's one of the home boys. We've grown up together, and I'm so fond of
      him. Only it's more the brother-and-sister sort of thing, if he'd let it
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Check off No. 1. What's No. 2?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lots older. Mr. Thomas Murray Smith is an unspoiled millionaire. If he
      weren't so serious and quite so dangerously near forty&mdash;well, I don't
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you kept No. 3 for the last because he's the best?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No-o-o-o. Because he's the nearest. He followed me down. You can see his
      name in all its luster on the Hotel Kast register, when you get back to
      the city&mdash;Preston Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll, at your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sounds Southern," commented the man below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Southern! He's more Southern than the South Pole. His ancestors fought
      all the wars and owned all the negroes&mdash;he calls them 'niggers'&mdash;and
      married into all the first families of Virginia, and all that sort of
      thing. He must quite hate himself, poor Fitz, for falling in love with a
      little Yankee like me. In fact, that's why I made him do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you wish he hadn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know. He's awfully good-looking and gallant
      and devoted and all that. Only he's such a prickly sort of person. I'd
      have to spend the rest of my life keeping him and his pride out of
      trouble. And I've no taste for diplomacy. Why, only last week he declined
      to dine with the President of the Republic because some one said that his
      excellency had a touch of the tar brush."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd better get out of this country before that gets back to
      headquarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he thought there was danger, he'd stay forever. I don't suppose Fitz
      is afraid of anything on earth. Except perhaps of me," she added
      after-thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young woman, you're a shameless flirt!" accused the invisible one in
      stern tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I am, it isn't going to hurt you. Besides, I'm not. And, anyway, who
      are you to judge me? You're not here as a judge; you're an augur. Now, go
      on and aug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aug?" repeated the other hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Do an augury. Tell me which."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! As for that, it's easy. None."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I much prefer to think of you, when you are gone, as unmarried.
      It's more in character with your voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of all the selfish pigs! Condemned to be an old maid, in order not
      to spoil an ideal! Perhaps you'd like to enter the lists yourself," she
      taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens, no!" he cried in the most unflattering alarm. "It isn't in
      my line&mdash;I mean I haven't time for that sort of thing. I'm a very
      busy man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look it! Or you did look it, scrambling about like a doodle bug after
      your absurd spectacles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no such insect as a doodle bug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there? How do you know? Are you personally acquainted with all the
      insect families?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. That's my business. I'm a scientist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, gracious! And I've appealed to you in a matter of sentiment! I might
      better have stuck to Fitz. Poor Fitz! I wonder if he's lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should he be lost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I lost him. Back there on the trail. Purposely. I sent him for
      water and then&mdash;I skipped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh-h-h! Then HE'S the goose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goose! Preston Fairfax Fitz&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the goose you said 'Boo!' to, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. You didn't steal his hat, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. It's my own hat. Why did you run away from him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He bored me. When people bore me, I always run away. I'm beginning to
      feel quite fugitive this very minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence below, a silence that piqued the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," she challenged, "haven't you anything to say before the court
      passes sentence of abandonment to your fate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking&mdash;frantically. But the thoughts aren't girl thoughts. I
      mean, they wouldn't interest you. I might tell you about some of my
      insects," he added hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're very interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You're worthless as an augur, and a flat failure as a
      conversationalist, when thrown on your own resources. So I shall shake the
      dust from my feet and depart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye!" he said desolately. "And thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For making music in my desert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's much better," she approved. "But you've paid your score with the
      orchids. If you have one or two more pretty speeches like that in stock, I
      might linger for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I'm all out of those," he returned. "But," he added
      desperately, "there's the hexagonal scarab beetle. He's awfully queer and
      of much older family even than Mr. Fitzwhizzle's. It is the hexagonal
      scarab's habit when dis&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have an encyclopaedia of our own at home," she interrupted coldly. "I
      didn't climb this mountain to talk about beetles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll talk some more about you, if you'll give me a little time to
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are very impertinent. I don't wish to talk about myself. Just
      because I asked your advice in my difficulties, you assume that I'm a
      little egoist&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please don't&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't interrupt. I'm very much offended, and I'm glad we are never going
      to meet. Just as I was beginning to like you, too," she added, with
      malice. "Good-bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," he answered mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his attentive ears failed to discern the sound of departing footsteps.
      The breeze whispered in the tree-tops. A sulphur-yellow bird, of French
      extraction, perched in a flowering bush, insistently demanded: "Qu'est-ce
      qu'il dit? Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?"&mdash;What's he say? WHAT'S he say?&mdash;over
      and over again, becoming quite wrathful because neither he nor any one
      else offered the slightest reply or explanation. The girl sympathized with
      the bird. If the particular he whose blond top she could barely see by
      peeping over the rock would only say something, matters would be easier
      for her. But he didn't. So presently, in a voice of suspiciously
      saccharine meekness, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Mr. Beetle Man, I'm lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you're not," he said reassuringly. "You're not a quarter of a mile
      from the Puerto del Norte Road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't know which direction&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly simple. Keep on over the top of the rock; turn left down the
      slope, right up the dry stream bed to a dead tree; bear right past&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's too many turns, I never could remember more than two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, listen," he said persuasively. "I can make it quite plain to you if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't WISH to listen! I'll never find it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll toss you up my compass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want your compass," she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long patient sigh exhaled from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me to guide you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she retorted, and was instantly panic-stricken, for the monosyllable
      was of that accent which sets fire to bridges and burns them beyond hope
      of return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she got to her feet. Perhaps she would have dared and gone; perhaps
      she would have swallowed pride and her negative, and made one more appeal.
      She turned hesitantly and saw the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small devil on stilts, not more than three or four inches tall,
      but there was no mistaking his identity. No other living thing could
      possess such demoniac little red-hot pin points of eyes, or be so bristly
      and grisly and vicious. The stilts suddenly folded flat, and the devil
      rushed upon his prey. The girl stepped back; her foot turned and caught,
      and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," the patient voice below was saying, "if you really think that
      you couldn't find the road, I could draw you a map and send it up by the
      hair route. But I really think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "BLUMP!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rock had turned over on his unprotected head and flattened him out
      forever. Such was his first thought. When he finally collected himself,
      his eyeglasses, and his senses, he sustained a second shock more violent
      than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two paces away, the Voice, duly and most appropriately embodied, sat
      half-facing him. The Voice's eyes confirmed his worst suspicions, and,
      dazed though they were at the moment, there were deep lights in them that
      wholly disordered his mental mechanism. Nor were her first words such as
      to restore his deranged faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh-h! Aren't you GOGGLESOME!" she cried dizzily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands to the huge brown spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;what did you come down for?" he babbled. There was a
      distinct note of accusation in the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      "COME down! I fell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; that may be true&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "MAY be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, it is true. I&mdash;I&mdash;I see it's true. I'm awfully
      sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry? What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you came. That you fell, I mean to say. I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't
      really know what I mean to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder, poor boy! I landed right on you, didn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you? Something did. I thought it was the mountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You aren't very complimentary," she pouted. "But there! I dare say I
      knocked your thoughts all to bits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not at all. Certainly, I mean. It doesn't matter. See here," he said,
      with an injured sharpness of inquiry born of his own exasperation at his
      verbal fumbling, "you said you wouldn't, and here you are. I ask you, is
      that fair and honorable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if it comes to that," she countered, "you promised that you'd never
      speak to me if you saw me, and here you are telling me that you don't want
      me around the place at all. It's very rude and inhospitable, I consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it," he said miserably. "I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look it. You look disagreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as you stayed where you belonged&mdash;Excuse me&mdash;I don't
      mean to be impolite&mdash;but I&mdash;I&mdash;You see&mdash;as long as you
      were just a voice, I could manage all right, but now that you are&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;you&mdash;"
      His speech trailed off lamentably into meaningless stutterings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned amazed and amused eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth ails the poor man?" she inquired of all creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you. I&mdash;I'm shy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not really! I thought it was a joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qu'est-ce qu'il dit? Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?" demanded the yellow-breasted
      inquisitor, from his flowery perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he say? He says he's shy. Poor poo&mdash;er young, helpless
      thing!" And her laughter put to shame a palm thrush who was giving what he
      had up to that moment considered a highly creditable musical performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right!" he retorted warmly. "Laugh if you want to! But after
      stipulating that we should be strangers, to&mdash;to act this way&mdash;well,
      I think it's&mdash;it's&mdash;forward. That's what I think it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, indeed? Perhaps you think it's pleasant for me, after I've opened
      my heart to a stranger, to have him forced on me as an acquaintance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From the depths of those limpid eyes welled up a little film of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Lord! Don't do that!" he implored. "I didn't mean&mdash;I'm a bear&mdash;a
      pig&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a scarab&mdash;I'm anything you choose. Only
      don't do that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not doing anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you're not. That's fine! As for your secrets, I dare say I
      wouldn't know you again if I saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wouldn't you?" she cried in quite another tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite likely not. These glasses, you see. They make things look quite
      queer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or if you heard me?" she challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well, that's different. But I forget quite easily&mdash;even things
      like voices."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, her hands in her lap, her eyes upon the goggled face
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then take them off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? My glasses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take them off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;why should I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you can see me better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to see you better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you do. I'm much more interesting than a scarab."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I know about scarabs and I don't know about&mdash;about&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls. So one might suspect. Do you know what I'm doing, Mr. Beetle Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "N-n-no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm flirting with you. I never flirted with a scientific person before.
      It's awfully one-sided, difficult, uphill work."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was all but drowned out in his flood of panicky instructions,
      from which she disentangled such phrases as "first to left"&mdash;"dry
      river-bed-hundred-yards"&mdash;"dead tree&mdash;can't miss it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you send me away now, I'll cry. Really, truly cry, this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you won't! I mean I won't! I&mdash;I'll do anything! I'll talk! I'll
      make conversation! How old are you? That's what the Chinese ask. I used to
      have a Chinese cook, but he lost all my shirt studs, playing fan-tan. Can
      you play fan-tan? Two can't play, though. They have funny cards in this
      country, like the Spanish. Have you seen a bullfight yet? Don't do it.
      It's dull and brutal. The bull has no more chance than&mdash;than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Than an unprotected man with a conscienceless flirt, who falls on his
      neck and then threatens to submerge him in tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you're beginning again!" he wailed. "What did you jump for, anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I slipped. An awful, red-eyed, scrambly fiend scared me&mdash;a real,
      live, hairy devilkin on stilts. He ran at me across the rock. Was that one
      of your pet scarabs, Mr. Beetle Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was a tarantula, I suppose, from the description."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're deadly, aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. Unscientific nonsense. I'll go up and chase him off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flying from perils that you know not of to more familiar dangers?" she
      taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, with the tarantula out of the way, there's no reason why
      you shouldn't&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, and leave you in peace? What do you think of that for gallantry,
      Birdie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gay-feathered inquisitor had come quite near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?" he queried, cocking his curious head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he doesn't like me one little, wee, teeny bit, and he wishes I'd
      go home and stay there. And so I'm going, with my poor little feelings all
      hurted and ruffled up like anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort," protested the badgered spectacle-wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why such unseemly haste to make my path clear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just thought that maybe you'd go back on the top of the rock, where you
      came from, and&mdash;and be a voice again. If you won't go, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made three jumps of it up the boulder, bearing a stick in his hand.
      Presently his face, preternaturally solemn and gnomish behind the goggles,
      protruded over the rim. The girl was sitting with her hands folded in her
      lap, contemplating the scenery as if she'd never had another interest in
      her life. Apparently she had forgotten his very existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahem!" he began nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahem!" she retorted so promptly that he almost fell off his precarious
      perch. "Did you ring? Number, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I knew whether you were laughing at me or not," he said ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. Your darkest suspicions are correct. Did you abolish my devilkin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drove him back into his trapdoor home and put a rock over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you destroy him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I've appointed him guardian of the rock, with strict instructions
      to bite any one that ever comes there after this except you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo! You're progressing. As soon as you're free from the blight of my
      regard, you become quite human. But I'll never come again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I suppose not," he said dismally. "I shan't hear you again, unless,
      perhaps, the echoes have kept your voice to play with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh! Is this the language of science? You know I almost think I should
      like to come&mdash;if I could. But I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we leave to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not across to the southern coast? It isn't safe. Fever&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; by Puerto del Norte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there is. You can just see her funnel over that white slope. It's
      our yacht."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think you are going in her to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think? I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he contradicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she asserted, quite as concisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he repeated. "You're mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be absurd. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out there, over that tree to the horizon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a sort of little smudge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a very shadowy sort of why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's substance enough under it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A riddle? I'll give it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; a bet. I'll bet you the treasures of my mountain-side. Orchids of
      gold and white and purple and pink, butterflies that dart on wings of fire
      opal&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beetles, to know which is to love them, and love but them forever," she
      laughed. "And my side of the wager&mdash;what is that to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will come to the rock day after to-morrow at this hour and stand
      on the top and be a voice again and talk to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done! Send your treasures to the pier, for you'll surely lose. And now
      take me to the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a single-file trail, and he walked in advance, silent as an Indian.
      As they emerged from a thicket into the highway, above the red-tiled city
      in its setting of emerald fields strung on the silver thread of the Santa
      Clara River, she turned and gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be at your rock to-morrow, and when you see the yacht steam out, you'll
      know I'll be saying good-bye, and thank you for your mountain treasures.
      Send them to Miss Brewster, care of the yacht Polly. She's named after me.
      Is there anything the matter with my shoes?" she broke off to inquire
      solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Er&mdash;what? No." He lifted his eyes, startled, and looked out across
      the quaint old city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then is there anything the matter with my face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? Well, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be hard to forget," complained he of the goggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then look away before it's too late," she cried merrily; but her color
      deepened a little. "Good-bye, O friend of the lowly scarab!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dip of the road down into the bridged arroyo, she turned, and was
      surprised&mdash;or at least she told herself so&mdash;to find him still
      looking after her.

    <h2>
      II. &mdash; AT THE KAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      One dines at the Gran Hotel Kast after the fashion of a champignon sous
      cloche. The top of the cloche is of fluted glass, with a wide aperture
      between it and the sides, to admit the rain in the wet season and the
      flies in the dry. Three balconies run up from the dining-room well to this
      roof, and upon these, as near to the railings as they choose, the rather
      conglomerate patronage of the place sleeps, takes baths, dresses, gossips,
      makes love, quarrels, and exchanges prophecies as to next Sunday's
      bullfight, while the diners below strive to select from the bill of fare
      special morsels upon which they will stake their internal peace for the
      day. No cabaret can hold a candle to it for variety of interest. When the
      sudden torrential storms sweep down the mountains at meal times, the
      little human champignons, beneath their insufficient cloche, rush about
      wildly seeking spots where the drippage will not wash their food away.
      Commercial travelers of the tropics have a saying: "There are worse hotels
      in the world than the Kast&mdash;but why take the trouble?" And, year upon
      year, they return there for reasons connected with the other hostelries of
      Caracuna, which I forbear to specify.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Miss Polly Brewster, the Kast was a place of romance. Five miles away,
      as the buzzard flies, she could have dined well, even elegantly, on the
      Brewster yacht. Would she have done it? Not for worlds! Miss Brewster was
      entranced by the courtly manners of her waiter, who had lost one ear and
      no small part of the countenance adjacent thereto, only too obviously
      through the agency of some edged instrument not wielded in the arts of
      peace. She was further delightedly intrigued by the abrupt appearance of a
      romantic-hued gentleman, who thrust out over the void from the second
      balcony an anguished face, one side of which was profusely lathered, and
      addressed to all the hierarchy of heaven above, and the peoples of the
      earth beneath, a passionate protest upon the subject of a cherished and
      vanished shaving brush; what time, below, the head waiter was hastily
      removing from sight, though not from memory, a soup tureen whose agitated
      surface bore a creamy froth not of a lacteal origin. One may not with
      impunity balance personal implements upon the too tremulous rails of the
      ancient Kast.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an appreciative and glowing eye, Miss Brewster read from her
      mimeographed bill of fare such legends as "ropa con carne," "bacalao
      seco," "enchiladas," and meantime devoured chechenaca, which, had it been
      translated into its just and simple English of "hash," she would not have
      given to her cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did her visual and prandial preoccupations inhibit her from a lively
      interest in the surrounding Babel of speech in mingled Spanish, Dutch,
      German, English, Italian, and French, all at the highest pitch, for a few
      rods away the cathedral bells were saluting Heaven with all the clangor
      and din of the other place, and only the strident of voice gained any heed
      in that contest. Even after the bells paused, the habit of effort kept the
      voices up. Miss Brewster, dining with her father a few hours after her
      return from the mountain, absolved her conscience from any intent of
      eavesdropping in overhearing the talk of the table to the right of her.
      The remark that first fixed her attention was in English, of the
      super-British patois.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't tell wot the blighter might look like behind those bloomin' brown
      glasses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he's not bothersome to any one," suggested a second speaker, in a
      slightly foreign accent. "He regards his own affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you are, bo!" approved a tall, deeply browned man of thirty, all
      sinewy angles, who, from the shoulders up, suggested nothing so much as a
      club with a gnarled knob on the end of it, a tough, reliable, hardwood
      club, capable of dealing a stiff blow in an honest cause. "If he deals in
      conversation, he must SELL it. I don't notice him giving any of it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gave some to Kast the last time he dined here," observed a languid and
      rather elegant elderly man, who occupied the fourth side of the table.
      "Mine host didn't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should suppose Senior Kast would be hardened," remarked the young
      Caracunan who had defended the absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our eyeglassed friend scored for once, though. They had just served him
      the usual table-d'hote salad&mdash;you know, two leaves of lettuce with a
      caterpillar on one. Kast happened to be passing. Our friend beckoned him
      over. 'A little less of the fauna and more of the flora, Senior Kast,'
      said he in that gritty, scientific voice of his. I really thought Kast was
      going to forget his Swiss blood, and chase a whole peso of custom right
      out of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you ask me, I think the blighter is barmy," asserted the Briton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll ask you," proffered the elegant one kindly. "Why do you
      consider him 'barmy,' as you put it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I first saw him here and heard him speak to the waiter, I knew him
      for an American Johnny at once, and I went, directly I'd finished my soup,
      and sat down at his table. The friendly touch, y' know. 'I say,' I said to
      him, 'I don't know you, but I heard you speak, and I knew at once you were
      one of these Americans&mdash;tell you at once by the beastly queer accent,
      you know. You are an American, ay&mdash;wot?' Wot d' you suppose the
      blighter said? He said, 'No, I'm an ichthyo'&mdash;somethin' or other&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ichthyosaurus, perhaps," supplied the Caracunuan, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, whatever it may be. 'I'm an ichthyosaurus,' he says. 'It's a
      very old family, but most of the buttons are off. Were you ever bitten by
      one in the fossil state? Very exhilaratin', but poisonous,' he says. 'So
      don't let me keep you any longer from your dinner.' Of course, I saw then
      that he was a wrong un, so I cut him dead, and walked away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Served him right," declared the elderly American, with a solemn twinkle
      directed at the tall brown man, who, having opened his mouth, now thought
      better of it, and closed it again, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is very kind," said the native. "When my brother fell and broke
      his arm on the mountain, this gentleman found him, took care of him, and
      brought him in on muleback."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lives up there somewhere, doesn't he, Mr. Raimonda?" asked the big man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the quinta of a deserted plantation," replied the Caracunan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wot's he do?" asked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, THAT one does not know, unless Senor Sherwen can tell us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," said the elderly man. "Some sort of scientific investigation,
      according to the guess of the men at the club."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never can tell down here," observed the Englishman darkly. "Might be
      a blind, you know. Calls himself Perkins. Dare say it isn't his name at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter," said Mr. Thatcher Brewster at this juncture, in a patient and
      plaintive voice, "for the fifth and last time, I implore you to pass me
      the butter, or that which purports to be butter, in the dish at your
      elbow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, poor dad! Forgive me! But I was overhearing some news of an&mdash;an
      acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know any of the gentlemen upon whose conversation you are
      eavesdropping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In financial circles, Mr. Brewster was credited with the possession of a
      cold blue eye and a denatured voice of interrogation, but he seldom
      succeeded in keeping a twinkle out of the one and a chuckle out of the
      other when conversing with his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," observed that damsel calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning, I suppose I am to understand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. Haven't you noticed them looking this way? Presently they'll
      be employing all their strategy to meet me. They'll employ it on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brewster surveyed the group dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a country such as this, one can't be too&mdash;too cau&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too particular, as you were saying," cut in his daughter cheerfully. "Men
      are scarce&mdash;except Fitzhugh, who is rather less scarce than I wish he
      were lately. You know," she added, with a covert glance at the adjoining
      table, "I wouldn't be surprised if you found yourself an extremely popular
      papa immediately after dinner. It might even go so far as cigars. Do you
      suppose that lovely young Caracunan is a bullfighter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I believe he's a coffee exporter. Less romantic, but more
      respectable. Quite one of the gilded youth of Caracuna. His name is
      Raimonda. Fitzhugh knows him. By the way, where on earth is Fitzhugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trying to fit a kind and gentlemanly expression over a swollen sense of
      injury, for a guess," replied the girl carelessly. "I left him in sweet
      and lone communion with nature three hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly, I wish&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dad, dear, don't! You'll get your wish, I suppose, and Fitz, too.
      Only I don't want to be hurried. Here he is, now. Look at that smile! A
      sculptor couldn't have done any better. Now, as soon as he comes, I'm
      going to be quite nice and kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Fairfax Preston Fitzhugh Carroll did not come direct to the
      Brewster table. Instead, he stopped to greet the elderly man in the
      near-by group, and presently drew up a chair. At first, their conversation
      was low-toned, but presently the young native added his more vivacious
      accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can tell?" the Brewsters heard him say, and marked the fatalistic
      gesture of the upturned hands. "They disappear. One does not ask questions
      too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not here," confirmed the big man. "Always room for a few more in the
      undersea jails, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always. But I think it was not that with Basurdo. I think it was
      underground, not undersea." He brushed his neck with his finger tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it dangerous for foreigners?" asked Carroll quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For every one," answered Sherwen; adding significantly: "But the
      Caracunan Government does not approve of loose fostering of rumors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll rose and came over to the Brewsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I bring Mr. Graydon Sherwen over and present him?" he asked. "I can
      vouch for him, having known his family at home, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bring them all, Fitzhugh," commanded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exponent of Southern aristocracy looked uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the others," he said, "Mr. Raimonda is a native&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the manners of a prince. I've quite fallen in love with him
      already," she said wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you wish it. But the other American is an ex-professional
      baseball player, named Cluff."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? 'Clipper' Cluff? I knew I'd seen him before!" cried Miss Polly. "He
      got his start in the New York State League. Why, we're quite old friends,
      by sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for Galpy, he's an underbred little cockney bounder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the most naive line of conversation I've ever listened to. I want
      all of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me bring Sherwen first," pleaded the suitor, and was presently
      introducing that gentleman. "Mr. Sherwen is in charge here of the American
      Legation," he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does one salute a real live minister?" queried Miss Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mistake me for anything so important," said Sherwen. "We're not
      keeping a minister in stock at present. My job is being a superior kind of
      janitor until diplomatic relations are resumed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness! It sounds like war," said Miss Brewster hopefully. "Is there
      anything as exciting as that going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. Just a temporary cessation of civilities between the two nations.
      If it weren't indiscreet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do be indiscreet!" implored the girl, with clasped hands. "I admire
      indiscretion in others, and cultivate it in myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll looked pained, as the other laughed and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it would certainly be most undiplomatic for me to hint that the
      great and friendly nation of Hochwald, which wields more influence and has
      a larger market here than any other European power, has become a little
      jealous of the growing American trade. But the fact remains that the
      Hochwald minister and his secretary, Von Plaanden, who is a very able
      citizen when sober,&mdash;and is, of course, almost always sober,&mdash;have
      not exerted themselves painfully to compose the little misunderstanding
      between President Fortuno and us. The Dutch diplomats, who are not as
      diplomatic in speech as I am, would tell you, if there were any of them
      left here to tell anything, that Von Plaanden's intrigues brought on the
      present break with them. So there you have a brief, but reliable 'History
      of Our Times in the Island Republic of Caracuna.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highly informative and improving to the untutored mind," Miss Brewster
      complimented him. "I like seeing the wires of empire pulled. More,
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you won't like the next so well," observed Carroll grimly. "There
      is bubonic plague here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;ah!" protested Sherwen gently. "The suspicion of plague. Quite a
      different matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which usually turns out to be the same, doesn't it?" inquired Mr.
      Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. People disappear, and one is not encouraged to ask about them.
      But then people disappear for many causes in Caracuna. Politics here are
      somewhat&mdash;well&mdash;Philadelphian in method. But&mdash;there is
      smoke rising from behind Capo Blanco."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there?" inquired the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lazaretto. Still, it might be yellow fever, or only smallpox. The
      Government is not generous with information. To have plague discovered now
      would be very disturbing to the worthy plans of the Hochwald Legation. For
      trade purposes, they would very much dislike to have the port closed for a
      considerable time by quarantine. The Dutch difficulty they can arrange
      when they will. But quarantine would bring in the United States, and that
      is quite another matter. Well, we'll see, when Dr. Pruyn gets here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Special-duty man of the United States Public Health Service. The best man
      on tropical diseases and quarantine that the service has ever had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't Luther Pruyn, is it?" inquired Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same. Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than I do, except by reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was in my class at college, but I haven't seen him since. I'd be glad
      to see him again. A queer, dry fellow, but character and grit to his
      backbone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd supposed he was younger," said Sherwen. "Anyway, he's comparatively
      new to the service. His rise is the more remarkable. At present, he's not
      only our quarantine representative, with full powers, but unofficially he
      acts, while on his roving commission, for the British, the Dutch, the
      French, and half the South American republics. I suppose he's really the
      most important figure in the Caracuna crisis&mdash;and he hasn't even got
      here yet. Perhaps our Hochwaldian friends have captured him on the quiet.
      It would pay 'em, for if there is plague here, he'll certainly trail it
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm tired of plague," announced Miss Polly. "Bring the others here
      and let's all go over to the plaza, where it's cool."
    </p>
    <p>
      To their open and obvious delight, exhibited jauntily by the Englishman,
      with awkward and admiring respectfulness by the ball-player, and with
      graceful ease by the handsome Caracunan, the rest were invited to join the
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let them scare you about plague, Miss Brewster," said Cluff, as
      they found their chairs. "Foreigners don't get it much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm not afraid! But, anyway, we shouldn't have time to catch even a
      cold. We leave to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" inquired Sherwen and Raimonda in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the yacht, from Puerto del Norte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if it were a British battleship," said Galpy. "Port's closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Quarantine already?" said Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarantine be blowed! It's the Dutch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you knew," said Sherwen. "All the town is ringing with the
      news. It just came in to-night. Holland has declared a blockade until
      Caracuna apologizes for the interference with its cable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And nothing can pass?" asked Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but an aeroplane or a submarine."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Miss Polly Brewster broke it with a curious question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What day is day after to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Several voices had answered her, but she paid little heed, for there had
      slipped over her shoulder a brown thin hand holding a cunningly woven
      closed basket of reedwork. A soft voice murmured something in Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he say?" asked the girl "For me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks it must be for you," translated Raimonda, "from the
      description."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What description?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was told to go to the hotel and deliver it to the most beautiful lady.
      There could hardly be any mistaking such specific instructions even by an
      ignorant mountain peon," he added, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl opened the curious receptacle, and breathed a little gasp of
      delight. Bedded in fern, lay a mass of long sprays aquiver with bells of
      the purest, most lucent white, each with a great glow of gold at its
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," observed the young Caracunan, "I see that you are persona grata with
      our worthy President, Miss Brewster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "President Fortuno?" asked the girl, surprised. "No; not that I'm aware
      of. Why do you say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is his special orchid&mdash;almost the official flower. They call it
      'the President's orchid.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he a monopoly of growing them?" asked Miss Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one can grow them. They die when transplanted from their native
      cliffs. But it's only the President's rangers who are daring enough to get
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they so inaccessible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. They grow nowhere but on the cliff faces, usually in the wildest
      part of the mountains. Few people except the hunters and mountaineers know
      where, and it's only the most adventurous of them who go after the
      flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you suppose this boy got these?" Miss Brewster indicated the shy and
      dusky messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimonda spoke to the boy for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he didn't collect them. Nor is he one of the President's men. I don't
      quite understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did gather them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that he will say is, 'the master.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Miss Brewster, and retired into a thoughtful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're very beautiful, aren't they?" continued the Caracunan. "And they
      carry a pretty sentiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," commanded the girl, emerging from her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mountaineers say that their fragrance casts a spell which carries the
      thought back to the giver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the language of science?" she queried absently, with a thought
      far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But no, senorita, assuredly not," said the young Caracufian. "It is the
      language&mdash;permit that I say it better in French&mdash;c'est le
      langage d'amour."

      III. &mdash; THE BETTER PART OF VALOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Night fell with the iron clangor of bells, and day broke to the
      accompaniment of further insensate jangling, for Caracuna City has the
      noisiest cathedral in the world; and still the graceful gray yacht Polly
      lay in the harbor at Puerto del Norte, hemmed in by a thin film of smoke
      along the horizon where the Dutch warship promenaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the side caverns off the main dining-room of the Hotel Kast, the
      yacht's owner, breakfasting with the yacht's tutelary goddess and the
      goddess's determined pursuer, discussed the blockade. Though Miss Polly
      Brewster kept up her end of the conversation, her thoughts were far upon a
      breeze-swept mountain-side. How, she wondered, had that dry and strange
      hermit of the wilds known the news before the city learned it? With her
      wonder came annoyance over her lost wager. The beetle man, she judged,
      would be coolly superior about it. So she delivered herself of sundry
      stinging criticisms regarding the conduct of the Caracunan Administration
      in having stupidly involved itself in a blockade. She even spoke of going
      to see the President and apprising him of her views.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to tell him how to run this foolish little island," said she,
      puckering a quaintly severe brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now is the appointed time for you to plunge in and change the course of
      empire," her father suggested to her. "There's an official morning
      reception at ten o'clock. We're invited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shan't go. I wouldn't give the old goose the satisfaction of going
      to his fiesta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning the noble and patriotic President?" said Carroll. "Treason most
      foul! The cuartels are full of chained prisoners who have said less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father can go with Mr. Sherwen. I shall do some important shopping,"
      announced Miss Brewster. "And I don't want any one along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus apprised of her intentions, Carroll wrapped himself in gloom, and
      retired to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Polly's shopping, being conducted mainly through the medium of the
      sign language, presently palled upon her sensibilities, and about twelve
      o'clock she decided upon a drive. Accordingly she stepped into one of the
      pretty little toy victorias with which the city swarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Para donde?" inquired the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fare made an expansive gesture, signifying "Anywhere." Being an astute
      person in his own opinion, the Jehu studied the pretty foreigner's attire
      with an appraising eye, profoundly estimated that so much style and
      elegance could be designed for only one function of the day, whirled her
      swiftly along the two-mile drive of the Calvario Road, and landed her at
      the President's palace, half an hour after the reception was over.
      Supposing from the coachman's signs that she was expected to go in and
      view some public garden, she paid him, walked far enough to be stopped by
      the apologetic and appreciative guard, and returned to the highway, to
      find no carriage in sight. Never mind, she reflected; she needed the
      exercise. Accordingly, she set out to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the noonday sun of Caracuia has a bite to it. For a time, Miss
      Brewster followed the car tracks which were her sure guide from the palace
      to the Kast; briskly enough, at first. But, after three cars had passed
      her, she began to think longingly of the fourth. When it stopped at her
      signal, it was well filled. The most promising ingress appeared to be
      across the blockade of a robust and much-begilded young man, who was
      occupying the familiar position of an "end-seat hog," and displaying the
      full glories of the Hochwaldian dress uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Plaanden was both sleepy and cross, for, having lingered after
      the reception to have a word and several drinks with the Minister of
      Foreign Affairs, he had come forth to find neither coach nor automobile in
      attendance. There had been nothing for it but the plebeian trolley.
      Accordingly, when he heard a foreign voice of feminine timbre and felt a
      light pressure against his knee, he only snorted. What he next felt
      against his knee was the impact of a half-shove, half-blow, brisk enough
      to slue him around. The intruder passed by to the vacant seat, while the
      now thoroughly awakened and annoyed Hochwaldian whirled, to find himself
      looking into a pair of expressionless brown goggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a snort of fury, the diplomat struck backward. The glasses and the
      solemn face behind them dodged smartly. The next moment, Herr von Plaanden
      felt his neck encircled by a clasp none the less warm for being not
      precisely affectionate. He was pinned. Twisting, he worked one arm loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful!" warned the cool voice of Polly Brewster, addressing her
      defender. "He's trying to draw his sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gogglesome one's grip slid a little lower. The car had now stopped,
      and the conductor came forward, brandishing what was apparently the wand
      of authority, designed to be symbolic rather than utile, since at no point
      was it thicker than a man's finger. From a safe distance on the
      running-board, he flourished this, whooping the while in a shrill and
      dissuasive manner. Somewhere down the street was heard a responsive yell,
      and a small, jerky, olive-green policia pranced into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon a strange thing happened. The rescuing knight relaxed his grip,
      leaped the back of his seat, dropped off the car, and darted like a hunted
      hare across a compound, around a wall, and so into the unknown, deserting
      his lady fair, if not precisely in the hour of greatest need, at least in
      a situation fraught with untoward possibilities. Indeed, it seemed as if
      these possibilities might promptly become actualities, for the diplomat
      turned his stimulated wrath upon the girl, and was addressing her in tones
      too emphatic to be mistaken when a large angular form interposed itself,
      landing with a flying leap on the seat between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Move!" the newly arrived one briefly bade Herr von Plaanden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Plaanden, feeling the pressure of a shoulder formed upon the
      generous lines of a gorilla's, and noting the approach of the policia on
      the other side, was fain to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you be scared, miss," said Cluff, turning to the girl. "It's all
      over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not frightened," she said, with a catch in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you ain't," he agreed reassuringly. "You just sit quiet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm MAD, clean through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You gotta right. You gotta perfect right. Now, if this was New York, I'd
      spread that gold-laced guy's face&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not angry at him. Not particularly, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?" queried her friend in need. "What got your goat, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brewster shot a quick and scornful glance over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, HIM!" interpreted the athlete. "Well, he made his get-away like a man
      with some reason for being elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reason enough. He was afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe. Being afraid's a queer thing," remarked her escort academically.
      "Now, me, I'm afraid of a fuzzy caterpillar. But I ain't exactly timid
      about other things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly aren't. And I don't know how to thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, that's awright, miss. What else could I do? Our departed friend,
      Professor Goggle-Eye, when he made his jump, landed right in my shirt
      front. 'Take my place,' he says; 'I've got an engagement.' Well, I was
      just moving forward, anyway, so it was no trouble at all, I assure you,"
      asserted the doughty Cluff, achieving a truly elegant conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most fortunate for me," said the girl sweetly. "Mr. Perkins scuttled away
      like one of his own little wretched beetles. When I see him again&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again? Oh, well, if he's a friend of yours, accourse he'd awtuv stood by&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't!" she declared, with unnecessary vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you be too hard on him, miss," argued her escort. "Seems to me he
      did a pretty good job for you, and stuck to it until he found some one
      else to take it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why didn't he stand by you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't carry any 'Help-wanted' signs on me. You know, miss, you
      can't size up a man in this country like he was at home. Now, me, I'd have
      natcherly hammered that Von Plaanden gink all to heh&mdash;heh&mdash;hash.
      But did I do it? I did not. You see, I got a little mining concession out
      here in the mountains, and if I was to get into any diplomatic mix-up and
      bring in the police, it'd be bad for my business, besides maybe getting me
      a couple of tons of bracelets around my pretty little ankles. Like as not
      your friend, Professor Lamps, has got an equally good reason for keeping
      the peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that this man will make trouble for you over this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as things stand. So long as nothing was done&mdash;no arrests or
      anything like that&mdash;he'll be glad to forget it, when he sobers up.
      I'll forget it, too, and maybe, miss, it wouldn't be any harm to anybody
      if you did a turn at forgetting, yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither by the venturesome Miss Polly nor by her athlete servitor was
      the episode to be so readily dismissed. Late that afternoon, when the
      Brewster party were sitting about iced fruit drinks amid the dingy and
      soiled elegance of the Kast's one private parlor, Mr. Sherwen's card
      arrived, followed shortly by Mr. Sherwen's immaculate self, creaseless
      except for one furrow of the brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you are going to get out of here I really don't know," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should we hurry?" inquired Miss Brewster. "I don't find Caracuna so
      uninteresting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never since I came here has it been so charming," said the legation
      representative, with a smiling bow. "But, much as your party adds to the
      landscape, I'm not at all sure that this city is the most healthful spot
      for you at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean the plague?" asked Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so loud, please. 'Healthful,' as I used it, was, in part, a
      figure of speech. Something is brewing hereabout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a revolution?" cried Miss Polly, with eyes alight. "Oh, do brew a
      revolution for me! I should so adore to see one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly you may, though I hardly think it. Some readjustment of foreign
      relations, at most. The Dutch blockade is, perhaps, only a beginning.
      However, it's sufficient to keep you bottled up, though if we could get
      word to them, I dare say they would let a yacht go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Senator Richland, of the Committee on Foreign Relations, is an old friend
      of my family," said Carroll, in his measured tones. "A cable&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would probably never get through. This Government wouldn't allow it.
      There are other possibilities. Perhaps, Mr. Brewster," he continued, with
      a side glance at the girl, "we might talk it over at length this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite useless, Mr. Sherwen," smiled the magnate. "Polly would have it all
      out of me before I was an hour older. She may as well get it direct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. It's this quarantine business. If Dr. Pruyn comes here
      and declares bubonic plague&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how will he get in?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as the blockade goes, the Dutch will help him all they can. But
      this Government will keep him out, if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not persona grata?" asked Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with any of the countries that play politics with pestilence. But if
      he's sent here, he'll get in some way. In fact, Stark, the public-health
      surgeon at Puerto del Norte, let fall a hint that makes me think he's on
      his way now. Probably in some cockleshell of a small boat manned by Indian
      smugglers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds almost too adventurous for the scholarly Pruyn whom I recall,"
      observed Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who went through the cholera anarchy on the lazar island off
      Camacho, with one case of medical supplies and two boxes of cartridges,
      may have been scholarly; he certainly didn't exhibit any distaste for
      adventure. Well, I wish he'd arrive and get something settled. Only I'd
      like to have you out of the way first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't send ME away, Mr. Sherwen," pleaded Miss Polly, with mischief
      in her eyes. "I'd make the cunningest little office assistant to busy old
      Dr. Pruyn. And he's a friend of dad's, and we surely ought to wait for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only I COULD send you! The fact is, Americans won't be very popular if
      matters turn out as I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we be confined to our rooms and kept incomunicado, while Dr. Pruyn
      chases the terrified germ through the streets of Caracuna?" queried the
      irrepressible Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll probably have to move to the legation, where you will be very
      welcome, but none too comfortable. The place has been practically closed
      and sealed for two months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure we should bother you dreadfully," said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would bother me more dreadfully if you got into any trouble. Just this
      morning there was some kind of an affair on a street car in which some
      Americans were involved."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Polly's countenance was a design&mdash;a very dainty and ornamental
      design&mdash;in insouciance as her father said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Americans? Any one we have met?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No news has come to me. I understand one of the diplomatic corps,
      returning from the President's matinee, spoke to an American woman, and an
      American man interfered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did this happen?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About noon. Inquiries are going on quietly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man directed a troubled and accusing look from his fine eyes
      upon Miss Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Miss Polly," he said, "no lady should go about unprotected down
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ordinarily it's as safe as any city," said Sherwen. "Just now I can't be
      so certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate being watched over like a child!" pouted Miss Brewster. "And I
      love sight-seeing alone. The flowers along the Calvario Road were so
      lovely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the road to the palace," remarked Carroll, looking at her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the butterflies are so marvelous," she continued cheerfully. "Who
      lives in that salmon-pink pagoda just this side of the curve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trouble sat dark and heavy upon the handsome features of Mr. Preston
      Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll, but he was too experienced to put a direct query
      to his inamorata. What suspicion he had, he cherished until after dinner,
      when he took it to the club and made it the foundation of certain
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that at eleven o'clock that evening, he paused before a
      bench in the plaza, bowered in the bloom of creepers which flowed down
      from a balcony of the Kast, and occupied by the comfortably sprawled-out
      form of Mr. Thomas Cluff, who was making a burnt offering to Morpheus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening!" said Mr. Carroll pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evenin'! How's things?" returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right as can be, thanks to you. On behalf of the Brewster family, I want
      to express our appreciation of your assistance to Miss Brewster this
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that was nothing," returned the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it might have been a great deal. Mr. Brewster will wish to thank you
      in person&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, forget it!" besought Mr. Thomas Cluff. "That little lady is all
      right. I'd just as soon eat an ambassador, let alone a gilt-framed
      secretary, to help her out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Brewster," said the other, somewhat more stiffly, "is a wholly
      admirable young lady, but she is not always well advised in going out
      unescorted. By the way, you can doubtless confirm the rumor as to the
      identity of her insulter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name is Von Plaanden. But I don't think he meant to insult any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will permit me to be the best judge of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go as far as you like," asserted the big fellow cheerfully. "That fellow
      Perkins can tell you more about the start of the thing than I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From what I hear, he has no cause to be proud of his part in the matter,"
      said the Southerner, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's sure a prompt little runner," asserted Cluff. "But I've run away in
      my time, and glad of the chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will excuse me from sympathizing with your standards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, you're excused," returned the athlete, so placidly that Carroll,
      somewhat at a loss, altered his speech to a more gracious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate, you stood your ground when you were needed, which is more
      than Mr. Perkins did. I should like to have a talk with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's easy. He was rambling around here not a quarter of an hour ago
      with young Raimonda. That's them sitting on the bench over by the
      fountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take me over and present me? I think it is due Mr. Perkins that
      some one should give him a frank opinion of his actions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to hear that," observed Cluff, who was not without humanistic
      curiosity. "Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaving up his six-feet-one from the seat, he led the way to the two
      conversing men. Raimonda looked around and greeted the newcomers
      pleasantly. Cluff waved an explanatory hand between his charge and the
      bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make you acquainted with Mr. Perkins," he said, neglecting to mention the
      name of the first party of the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins, goggling upward to meet a coldly hostile glance, rose, nodded in
      some wonder, and said: "How do you do?" Raimonda sent Cluff a glance of
      interrogation, to which that experimentalist in human antagonisms
      responded with a borrowed Spanish gesture of pleasurable uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not say that I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Perkins," began Carroll
      weightily, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he expected a query, he was doomed to a disappointment. Such of the
      Perkins features as were not concealed by his extraordinary glasses
      expressed an immovable calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless you know to what I refer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still those blank brown glasses regarded him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you or do you not?" demanded Carroll, struggling to keep his temper in
      the face of this exasperating irresponsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't the least idea," replied Perkins equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were on the tram this morning when Miss Brewster was insulted,
      weren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ran away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you run away for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ran away," the other sweetly informed him, "on important business of my
      own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cluff snickered. The suspicion impinged upon Carroll's mind that this
      wasn't going to be as simple as he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let that go for the moment. Do you know Miss Brewster's insulter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you telling me the truth?" asked the Southerner sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The begoggled one's chin jerked up. To the trained eye of Cluff, swift to
      interpret physical indications, it seemed that Perkins's weight had almost
      imperceptibly shifted its center of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our Southern friend is going to run into something if he doesn't look
      out," he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no hint of trouble in Perkins's voice as he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know who he is. I don't know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it Von Plaanden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you want to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," returned the other, with convincing coolness, "if it was, I
      intend to slap his face publicly as soon as I can find him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must do nothing of the sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, indeed, there was a change in the other's bearing. The words came
      sharp and crisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do exactly as I said. Perhaps you will explain why you think
      otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you must have some sense somewhere about you. Do you realize
      where you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly think you can teach me geography, or anything else, Mr.
      Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, good God," said the other sharply, "somebody's got to teach you!
      What do you suppose would be the result of your slapping Von Plaanden's
      face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever it may be, I am ready. I will fight him with any weapons, and
      gladly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; gladly! Fun for you, all right. But suppose you think of others
      a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid of being involved yourself?" smiled Carroll. "I'm sure you could
      run away successfully from any kind of trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Others might not be so able to escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I'm wholly wrong, and my training and traditions are absurdly
      old-fashioned, but I've been brought up to believe that the American who
      will run from a fight, or who will not stand up at home or abroad for
      American rights, American womanhood, and the American flag, isn't a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, keep it for the Fourth of July," returned Perkins wearily. "You can't
      get me into a fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fight?" Carroll laughed shortly. "If you had the traditions of a
      gentleman, you would not require any more provocation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had the traditions of a deranged doodle bug, I'd go around hunting
      trouble in a country that is full of it for foreigners&mdash;even those
      who behave themselves like sane human beings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meaning, perhaps, that I'm not a sane human being?" inquired the
      Southerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you act like it? To satisfy your own petty vanity of
      courage, you'd involve all of us in difficulties of which you know
      nothing. We're living over a powder magazine here, and you want to light
      matches to show what a hero you are. Traditions! Don't you talk to me
      about traditions! If you can serve your country or a woman better by
      running away than by fighting, the sensible thing to do is to run away.
      The best thing you can do is to keep quiet and let Von Plaanden drop.
      Otherwise, you'll have Miss Brewster the center of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your tongue from that lady's name!" warned Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're giving a good many orders," said the other slowly. "But I'll do
      almost anything just now to keep you peaceable, and to convince you that
      you must let Von Plaanden strictly alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as surely as I meet him," said the Southerner ominously, "on my word
      of honor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment," broke in the other sharply. "Don't commit yourself until
      you've heard me. Just around the corner from here is a cuartel. It isn't a
      nice clean jail like ours at home. Fleas are the pleasantest companions in
      the place. When a man&mdash;particularly an obnoxious foreigner&mdash;lands
      there, they are rather more than likely to forget little incidentals like
      food and water. And if he should happen to be of a nation without
      diplomatic representation here, as is the case with the United States at
      present, he might well lie there incomunicado until his hearing, which
      might be in two days or might not be for a month. Is that correct, Mr.
      Raimonda?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Essentially," confirmed the Caracunan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you are through trying to frighten me&mdash;" began Carroll
      contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frighten you? I'm not so foolish as to waste time that way. I'm trying to
      warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not. On MY honor&mdash;" He broke off as Carroll smiled. "Smile if
      you like, but believe what I'm telling you. Unless you agree to keep your
      hands and tongue off Von Plaanden I'll lay an information which will land
      you in the cuartel within an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile froze on the Southerner's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could he do that?" he asked Raimonda.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid he could. And, really, Mr. Carroll, he's correct in principle.
      In the present state of political feeling, an assault by an American upon
      the representative of Hochwald might seriously endanger all of your
      party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," Cluff supported him. "I'm with you in wanting to break
      that gold-frilled geezer's face up into small sections, but it just won't
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort, Carroll recovered his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Raimonda," he said courteously, "I give YOU my word that there will
      be no trouble between Herr Von Plaanden and myself, of my seeking, until
      Mr. and Miss Brewster are safely out of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough," said Cluff heartily. "The rest of us can take care of
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meantime," said Raimonda, "I think the whole matter can be arranged. Von
      Plaanden shall apologize to Miss Brewster to-morrow. It is not his first
      outbreak, and always he regrets. My uncle, who is of the Foreign Office,
      will see to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that's settled," remarked Perkins cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll turned upon him savagely:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your entire satisfaction, no doubt, now that you've shown yourself an
      informer as well as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy with the rough stuff, Mr. Carroll," advised Cluff, his good-natured
      face clouding. "We're all a little het up. Let's have a drink, and cool
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With you, with pleasure. I shall hope to meet you later, Mr. Perkins," he
      added significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope not," retorted the other. "My voice is still for peace.
      Meantime, please assure Miss Brewster for me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warned you to keep that lady's name from your lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did. But I don't know by what authority. You're not her father, I
      suppose. Are you her brother, by any chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Perkins experienced that curious feeling that some invisible
      person was trying to catch his eye. Now, as he turned directly upon
      Carroll, his glance, passing over his shoulder, followed a broad ray of
      light spreading from a second-story leaf-framed balcony of the hotel.
      There was a stir amid the greenery. The face of the Voice appeared, framed
      in flowers. Its features lighted up with mirth, and the lips formed the
      unmistakable monosyllable: "Boo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The identification was complete&mdash;"Boo to a goose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preston Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll!" Unwittingly he spoke the name aloud,
      and, unfortunately, laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a less sensitive temperament, even, than Carroll's, the provocation
      would have been extreme. Perkins was recalled to a more serious view of
      the situation by the choking accents of that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take off your glasses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I'm going to thrash you within an inch of your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen!" cried the young Caracunan. "This is no place for
      such an affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently Perkins held the same belief. Stepping aside, he abruptly sat
      down on the end of the bench, facing the fountain and not four feet from
      it. His head drooped a little forward; his hands dropped between his
      knees; one foot&mdash;but Cluff, the athlete, was the only one to note
      this&mdash;edged backward and turned to secure a firm hold on the
      pavement. Carroll stepped over in front of him and stood nonplused. He
      half drew his hand back, then let it fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't hit a man sitting down," he muttered distressfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins's set face relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Running true to tradition," he observed, pleasantly enough. "I didn't
      think you would. See here, Mr. Carroll, I'm sorry that I laughed at your
      name. In fact, I didn't really laugh at your name at all. It was at
      something quite different which came into my mind at that moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your apology is accepted so far," returned the other stiffly. "But that
      doesn't settle the other account between us, when we meet again. Or do you
      choose to threaten me with jail for that, also?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. It's easier to keep out of your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" cried the Southerner in disgust. "Are you afraid of
      everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no!" Perkins rose, smiling at him with perfect equanimity. "As a
      matter of fact, if you're interested to know, I wasn't particularly afraid
      of Von Plaanden, and, if I may say so without offense, I'm not
      particularly afraid of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll studied him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove, I believe you aren't! I give it up!" he cried desperately.
      "You're crazy, I reckon&mdash;or else I am." And he took himself off
      without the formality of a farewell to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raimonda, with a courteous bow to his companions, followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearily the goggled one sank back in his seat. Cluff moved across,
      planting himself exactly where Carroll had stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" responded the sitter absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do if I should bat you one in the eye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, too?" cried the bewildered Perkins. "Why on earth&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd dive into my knees, wouldn't you, and tip me over backward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that!" A slow grin overspread the space beneath the glasses. "That
      was the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the trick. It's a good one&mdash;except for the guy that gets it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wouldn't have hurt him. He'd have landed in the fountain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he would. What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'd have held him there till he got cooled off, and then made a run
      for it. A wet man can't catch a dry man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, son, YOU'RE a dry one, all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wake up! I'm saying you're all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly took enough off him to rile a sheep. Why didn't you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tip him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins glanced upward at the balcony where the vines had closed upon a
      face that smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," he said mildly, "he's a friend of a friend of mine."

    <h2>
      IV. &mdash; TWO ON A MOUNTAIN-SIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      ORCHIDS do not, by preference, grow upon a cactus plant. Little though she
      recked of botany, Miss Brewster was aware of this fundamental truth.
      Neither do they, without extraneous impulsion, go hurtling through the air
      along deserted mountain-sides, to find a resting-place far below; another
      natural-history fact which the young lady appreciated without being
      obliged to consult the literature of the subject. Therefore, when, from
      the top of the appointed rock, she observed a carefully composed bunch of
      mauve Cattleyas describe a parabola and finally join two previous clusters
      upon the spines of a prickly-pear patch, she divined some energizing force
      back of the phenomenon. That energizing force she surmised was temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie!" said she severely. "Beetle gentlemen should control their little
      feelings. Naughty, naughty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From below rose a fervid and startled exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughtier, naughtier!" deprecated the visitor. "Are these the cold and
      measured terms of science?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't lived up to your bet," complained the censured one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I have! I always play fair, and pay fair. Here I am, as per
      contract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly half an hour late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. Four-thirty was the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now it is three minutes to five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Making twenty-seven minutes that I've been sitting here waiting for a
      welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiting? Oh, Miss Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not Miss Brewster. I'm a voice in the wilderness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Voice, you haven't been there more than one minute. A voice isn't a
      voice until it makes a noise like a voice. Q.E.D."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something in that argument," she admitted. "But why didn't you
      come up and look for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does one look for a sound?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't be so logical. It tires my poor little brain. You might at
      least have called."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would have been like holding you up for payment of the bet, wouldn't
      it? I was waiting for you to speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not good form in Caracuna. The senor should always speak first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You began the other time," he pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I did, but that was under a misapprehension. I hadn't learned the
      customs of the country then. By the way, is it a local custom for hermits
      of science to climb breakneck precipices for golden-hearted orchids to
      send to casual acquaintances?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that what you are?" he queried in a slightly depressed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth else could I be?" she returned, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. But we all like to pretend that our fairy tales are permanent,
      don't we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can readily picture you chasing beetles, but I can't see you chasing
      fairies at all," she asserted positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor can I. If you chase them, they vanish. Every one knows that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, your orchids were fit for a fairy queen. I haven't thanked you
      for them yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed you have. Much more than they deserve. By coming here to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that was a point of honor. Are you going to let those lovely purple
      ones wither on that prickly plant down there? Think how much better they'd
      look pinned on me&mdash;if there were any one here to see and appreciate."
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were a hint, it failed of its aim, for, as the hermit scuttled out
      from his shelter, looking not unlike some bulky protrusive-eyed insect,
      secured the orchids, and returned, he never once glanced up. Safe again in
      his rock-bound retreat, he spoke:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you do know something of fairies and fairy lore!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it wasn't much more than a hundred years ago that I read my Grimm. In
      the story, only one call was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't spare any more of my silken tresses. I brought a string
      this time. Where's the other hair line?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've used it to tether a fairy thought so that it can't fly away from me.
      Draw up slowly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you so much, and I'm so glad that you are feeling better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Better than the day before yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Day before yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless the poor man! Much anxious waiting hath bemused his wits. He thinks
      he's an echo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I was all right the day before yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You weren't. You were a prey to the most thrilling terrors. You were a
      moving picture of tender masculinity in distress. You let bashfulness like
      a worm i' th' bud prey upon your damask cheek. Have you a damask cheek?
      Stand out! I wish to consider you impartially. YOU needn't look at ME, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to," he assured her, stepping forth obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Basilisk that I am!" she laughed. "How brown you are! How long did you
      say you'd been here? A year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fourteen weary Voiceless months. Not on this island, you know, but around
      the tropics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you look vigorous and alert; not like the men I've seen come back
      from the hot countries, all languid and worn out. And you do look clean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't I be clean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you should. But people get slack, don't they, when they live
      off all alone by themselves? Still, I suppose you spruced up a little for
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort," he denied, with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? Oh, my poor little vanity! He wouldn't dress up for us, Vanity,
      though we did dress up for him, and we're looking awfully nice&mdash;for a
      voice, that is. Do you always keep so soft and pink and smooth, Mr. Beetle
      Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own a razor, if that's what you mean. You're making fun of me. Well, <i>I</i>
      don't mind." He lifted his voice and chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Although beyond the pale of law,
    He always kept a polished jaw;
    For he was one of those who saw
        A saving hope
        In shaving soap."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oh, lovely! What a noble finish. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Extract from 'Biographical Blurbings.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Autobiographical?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. By Me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you beyond the pale of law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poetical license," he explained airily. "Hold on, though." He fell silent
      a moment, and out of that silence came a short laugh. "I suppose I AM
      beyond the pale of law, now that I come to think of it. But you needn't be
      alarmed, I'm not a really dangerous criminal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later she was to recall that confession with sore misgivings. Now she only
      inquired lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that why you ran away from the tram car yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ran away? I didn't run away," he said, with dignity. "It just happened
      that there came into my mind an important engagement that I'd forgotten.
      My memory isn't what it should be. So I just turned over the matter in
      hand to an acquaintance of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The matter in hand being me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes; and the acquaintance being Mr. Cluff. I saw him throw four men
      out of a hotel once for insulting a girl, so I knew that he was much
      better at that sort of thing than I. May I go back now and sit down?" "Of
      course. I don't know whether I ought to thank you about yesterday or be
      very angry. It was such an extraordinary performance on your part&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing extraordinary about it." His voice came up out of the shadow,
      full of judicial confidence. "Merely sound common sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To leave a woman who has been insulted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In more competent hands than one's own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I give it up!" she cried. "I don't understand you at all. Fitzhugh is
      right; you haven't a tradition to your name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tradition," he repeated thoughtfully. "Why, I don't know. They're pretty
      rigid things, traditions. Rusty in the joints and all that sort of thing.
      Life isn't a process of machinery, exactly. One has to meet it with
      something more supple and adjustable than traditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your philosophy? Suppose a man struck you. Wouldn't you hit him
      back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps. It would depend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or insulted your country? Don't you believe that men should be ready to
      die, if necessary, in such a cause?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some men. Soldiers, for instance. They're paid to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! Is it all a question of pay in your mind? Wouldn't YOU,
      unless you were paid for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell until the occasion arises?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasn't the man any blood in his veins?" cried his inquisitor,
      exasperated. "Haven't you ever been angry clear through?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course; and sorry for it afterward. One is likely to lose one's
      temper any time. It might easily happen to me and drive me to make a fool
      of myself, like&mdash;like&mdash;" His voice trailed off into a silence of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like Fitzhugh Carroll. Why not say it? Well, I much prefer him and his
      hot-headedness to you and your careful wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he acquiesced patiently. "Any girl would. It's the romantic
      temperament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yours is the scientific, I suppose. That doesn't take into account
      little things like patriotism and heroism, does it? Tell me, have you
      actually ever admired&mdash;really got a thrill out of&mdash;any deed of
      heroism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," he replied tranquilly. "I've done my bit of hero worship in my
      time. In fact, I've never quite recovered from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Really? Do go on. You're growing more human every minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you happen to know anything about the Havana campaign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much. It never seemed to me anything to brag of. Dad says the
      Spanish-American War grew a crop of newspaper-made heroes, manufactured by
      reporters who really took more risks and showed more nerve than the men
      they glorified."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spanish-American War? That isn't what I'm talking about. I'm speaking of
      Walter Reed and his fellow scientists, who went down there and fought the
      mosquitoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's lip curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's your idea of heroism! Scrubby peckers into the lives of
      helpless bugs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you the faintest idea what you are talking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had abruptly hardened. There was an edge to it; such an edge as
      she had faintly heard on the previous night, when Carroll had pressed him
      too hard. She was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I haven't," she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's time you learned. Three American doctors went down into that
      pesthole of a Cuban city to offer their lives for a theory. Not for a
      tangible fact like the flag, or for glory and fame as in battle, but for a
      theory that might or might not be true. There wasn't a day or a night that
      their lives weren't at stake. Carroll let himself be bitten by infected
      mosquitoes on a final test, and grazed death by a hair's breadth. Lazear
      was bitten at his work, and died in the agony of yellow-fever convulsions,
      a martyr and a hero if ever there was one. Because of them, Havana is safe
      and livable now. We were able to build the Panama Canal because of their
      work, their&mdash;what did you call it?&mdash;scrubby peeking into the
      lives of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" cried the girl. "I&mdash;I'm ashamed. I didn't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should you?" he said, in a changed tone. "We Americans set up
      monuments to our destroyers, not to our preservers, of life. Nobody knows
      about Walter Reed and James Carroll and Jesse Lazear&mdash;not even the
      American Government, which they officially served&mdash;except a few
      doctors and dried-up entomologists like myself. Forgive me. I didn't mean
      to deliver a lecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, which she broke with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Voice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I'm beginning to think you rather more man than beetle at times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, you touched me on a point of fanaticism," he apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind standing up again for examination? No," she decided, as he
      stepped out and stood with his eyes lowered obstinately. "You don't seem
      changed to outward view. You still remind me," with a ripple of
      irrepressible laughter, "of a near-sighted frog. It's those ridiculous
      glasses. Why do you wear them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To keep the sun out of my eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the moon at night, I suppose. They're not for purposes of disguise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disguise! What makes you say that?" he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bark. They'd be most effective. And they certainly give your face a
      truly weird expression, in addition to its other detriments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't like my face, consider my figure," he suggested
      optimistically. "What's the matter with that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stumpy," she pronounced. "You're all in a chunk. It does look like a
      practical sort of a chunk, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you like it?" he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well enough of its kind." She lifted her voice and chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "He was stubby and square,
    But SHE didn't much care.
</pre>
    <p>
      "There's a verse in return for yours. Mine's adapted, though.
      Examination's over. Wait. Don't sit down. Now, tell me your opinion of
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very musical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not musical at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm considering you as a VOICE."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm tired of being just a voice. Look up here. Do," she pleaded. "Turn
      upon me those lucent goggles."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    When orbs like thine the soul disclose,
     Tee-deedle-deedle-dee.
</pre>
    <p>
      Don't be afraid. One brief fleeting glance ere we part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he returned positively. "Once is enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On behalf of my poor traduced features, I thank you humbly. Did they
      prove as bad as you feared?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse. I've hardly forgotten yet what you look like. Your kind of face is
      bad for business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't I told you? I'm a scientist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm a specimen. No beetle that crawls or creeps or hobbles, or does
      whatever beetles are supposed to do, shows any greater variation from type&mdash;I
      heard a man say that in a lecture once&mdash;than I do. Can't I interest
      you in my case, O learned one? The proper study of mankind is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman. Yes, I know all about that. But I'm a groundling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man," she said, in a tremulous voice, "the rock is moving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel it. Though it might be a touch of earthquake. We have 'em
      often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not your rock. The tarantula rock, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! A hundred tarantulas couldn't stir it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it seems to be moving, and that's just as bad. I'm tired and I'm
      lonely. Oh, please, Professor Scarab, have I got to fall on your neck
      again to introduce a little human companionship into this conversation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caesar! No! My shoulder's still lame. What do you want, anyway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know about you and your work. ALL about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! Well, at present I'm making some microscopical studies of insects.
      That's the reason for these glasses. The light is so harsh in these
      latitudes that it affects the vision a trifle, and every trifle counts in
      microscopy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the microscope add charm to the beetle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day I'll show you, if you like. Just now it's the flea, the national
      bird of Caracuna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wicked flea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows how wicked until he has studied him on his native heath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't the flea have something to do with plague? They say there's
      plague in the city now. You knew all about the Dutch. Do you know anything
      about the plague?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been listening to bolas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's a bola?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bola is information that somebody who is totally ignorant of the facts
      whispers confidentially in your ear with the assurance that he knows it to
      be authentic&mdash;in other words, a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there isn't any plague down under those quaint, old, red-tiled
      roofs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who ever knows what's going on under those quaint, old, red-tiled roofs?
      No foreigner, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even I can feel the mystery, little as I've seen of the place," said the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's the Indian of it. The tiled roofs are Spanish; the speech is
      Spanish; but just beneath roof and speech, the life and thought are
      profoundly and unfathomably Indian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with all the Caracunans, surely. Take Mr. Raimonda, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's different. Twenty families of the city, perhaps, are
      pure-bloods. There are no finer, cleaner fellows anywhere than the
      well-bred Caracunans. They are men of the world, European educated, good
      sportsmen, straight, honorable gentlemen. Unfortunately not they, but a
      gang of mongrel grafters control the politics of the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a hermit of science, you seem to know a good deal of what goes on. By
      the way, Mr. Raimonda called on me&mdash;on us last evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he mentioned. Rather serious, that, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it. He was very amusing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless," commented the other dryly. "But it isn't fair to play the
      game with one who doesn't know the rules. Besides, what will Mr. Preston
      Fairfax&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a professedly shy person, you certainly take a rather intimate tone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm shy only under the baleful influence of the feminine eye.
      Besides, you set the note of intimacy when you analyzed my personal
      appearance. And finally, I have a warm regard for young Raimonda."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have I," she returned maliciously. "Aren't you jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please be a little bit jealous. It would be so flattering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealousy is another tradition in which I don't believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can't flirt with you at all?" she sighed. "After taking all this
      long hot walk to see you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PLOP! The sound punctured the silence sharply, though not loudly. Some
      large fruit pod bursting on a distant tree might have made such a report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?" asked the girl curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That? Oh, that was a revolver shot," he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you casual! Do revolver shots mean nothing to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That one shakes my soul's foundations." His tone by no means indicated an
      inner cataclysm. "It may mean that I must excuse myself and leave. Just a
      moment, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing across the line of her vision, he disappeared to the left. When
      she next heard his voice, it was almost directly above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," it said. "There's no hurry. The flag's not up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What flag?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The flag in my compound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you see your home from here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; there's a ledge on the cliff that gives a direct view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to come up and see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't. It's much too hard a climb. Besides, there are rock devilkins
      on the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you hear a shot, you go up there for messages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it's my telephone system."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's at the other end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The peon who pretends to look after the quinta for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man! No man can keep a house fit to live in," she said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it; but he's all I've got in the servant line."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far is the house from here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mile, by air. Seven by trail from town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it lonely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt very sorry for him. There was such a quiet, conclusive
      acceptance of cheerlessness in the monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How soon must you go back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not for an hour, at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's a call, it must be an important one, so far from civilization."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not necessarily. Don't you ever have calls that are not important?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Brewster!" he called. "Oh, Voice! You haven't gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't fair," he complained, making his way swiftly down, and
      satisfying himself by a peep about the angle commanding her point of the
      rock that she had, indeed, vanished. Sadly he descended to his own nook&mdash;and
      jumped back with a half-suppressed yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't jump out of your skin on my account," said Miss Polly
      Brewster, with a gracious smile. "I'm not a devilkin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are! That is&mdash;I mean&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon. I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor man's having another bashful fit," she observed, with malicious
      glee. "Did the bold, bad, forward American minx scare it almost out of its
      poor shy wits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;you startled me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she exclaimed, in wide-eyed mock surprise. "Who would have supposed
      it? You didn't expect me down here, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she got a return shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did," he said; "sooner or later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't fib. Don't pretend that you knew I was here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-w-well, no. Not just now. B-b-but I knew you'd come if&mdash;if&mdash;if
      I pretended I didn't want you to long enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young and budding scientist," said she severely, "you're a gay deceiver.
      Is it because you have known me in some former existence that you are able
      thus accurately to read my character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I knew you wouldn't stay up there much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm angry at you; very angry at you. That is, I would be if it weren't
      that you really didn't mean it when you said that you really didn't want
      to see my face again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did any one ever see your face once without wanting to see it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, bravo!" She clapped her hands gayly. "Marvelous improvement under my
      tutelage! Where, oh, where is your timidity now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;I forgot," he stammered, "As long as I don't think, I'm
      all right. Now, you&mdash;you&mdash;you've gone and spoiled me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the pity of it! Let's find some mild, impersonal topic, then, that
      won't embarrass you. What do you do under the shadow of this rock, in a
      parched land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Work. Besides, it isn't a parched land. Look on this side."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a dozen steps brought her around the farther angle, where, hidden in
      a growth of shrubbery, lay a little pool of fairy loveliness,
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my outdoor laboratory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dreamery, I'd call it. May I sit down? Are there devilkins here?
      There's an elfkin, anyway," she added, as a silvered dragon-fly hovered
      above her head inquisitively before darting away on his own concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of my friends and specimens. I'm studying his methods of aviation
      with a view to making some practical use of what I learn, eventually."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really? Are you an inventor, too? I'm crazy about aviation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then you'll be interested in this," he said, now quite at his ease.
      "You know that the mosquito is the curse of the tropics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of other places, as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in the tropics it means yellow fever, Chagres fever, and other
      epidemic illness. Now, the mosquito, as you doubtless realize, is a
      monoplane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A monoplane?" repeated the girl, in some puzzlement. "How a monoplane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you claimed some knowledge of aviation. Its wings are all on
      one plane. The great natural enemy of the mosquito is the dragon-fly, one
      of which just paid you a visit. Now, modern warfare has taught us that the
      most effective assailant of the monoplane is a biplane. You know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Y-y-yes," said the girl doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore, if we can breed a biplane dragonfly in sufficient numbers, we
      might solve the mosquito problem at small expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know much about science," she began, "but I should hardly have
      supposed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's curious how nature varies the type of aviation," he continued
      dreamily. "Now, the pigeon is, of course, a Zeppelin; whereas the sea
      urchin is obviously a balloon; and the thistledown an undirigible&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're making fun of me!" she accused, with sharp enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else have you done to me ever since we met?" he inquired mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I AM angry! I shall go home at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      A second far-away PLOP! set a period to her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So shall I," said he briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that signal mean hurry up?" she asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it means that I'm wanted. You go first. When will you come again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'm angry. Didn't I tell you that? I don't permit people to
      make fun of me. Besides, you must come and see me next. You owe me two
      calls. Will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must surely come and conquer this cowardice. Will you come
      to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brewster opened wide her eyes upon him. She was little accustomed to
      have her invitations, which she issued rather in the manner of royal
      commands, thus casually received. Had the offender been any other of her
      acquaintance, she would have dropped the matter and the man then and
      there. But this was a different species. Graceful and tactful he might not
      be, but he was honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got something more important to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're reverting to type sadly. What is it that's so important?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can work any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Unfortunately I have to eat and sleep sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The implication she accepted quite seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you really as busy as all that? I'm quite conscience-stricken over
      the time I've wasted for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not wasted at all. You've cheered me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's something. But you won't come to the city to be cheered up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I will. When I get time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you won't find me at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, then," she laughed, "until your leisure day arrives."
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed the rock, stepping as strongly and surely as a lithe animal.
      At the top, the spirit of roguery, ever on her lips and eyes, struck in
      and possessed her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O disciple of science!" she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not from here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! I'm a Voice again. So don't be timid. Will you answer a question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've answered a hundred already. One more won't hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I speak plainly enough? Have&mdash;you&mdash;ever&mdash;been&mdash;in&mdash;love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," she railed. "With a woman, of course. I don't mean with your
      musty science."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you needn't be violent. Have you ever been in love with ANYTHING?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, perhaps!" she taunted. "There are no perhapses in that. With what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With what every man in the world is in love with once in his life," he
      replied thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little still step forward and peeped down at him. He stood
      leaning against the face of the rock, gazing out over the hot blue
      Caribbean, his hat pushed back and his absurd goggles firm and high on his
      nose. His words and voice were in preposterous contrast to his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Riddle me your riddle," she commanded. "What is every man in love with
      once in his life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ideal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! And your ideal&mdash;where do you keep it safe from the common gaze?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tether it to my heart&mdash;with a single hair," said the man below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," commented Miss Brewster, in a changed tone. And, again, "Oh," just a
      little blankly. "I wish I hadn't asked that," she confessed silently to
      herself, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the spirit of reckless experimentalism pressed her onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a peril to the scientific mind, you know," she warned. "Suppose
      your ideal should come true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't," said he comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brewster's regrets sensibly mitigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, of course, your career is safe from accident," she
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved out into the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man," she called,
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and saw her with her chin cupped in her hand, regarding him
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm NOT just a casual acquaintance," she said suddenly. "That is, if you
      don't want me to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good," was his hearty comment. "I'm glad you like me better than
      you did at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm not so sure that I like you, exactly. But I'm coming to have a
      sort of respectful curiosity about you. What lies under that beetle shell
      of yours, I wonder?" she mused, in a half breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not he heard the final question she could not tell. He smiled,
      waved his hand, and disappeared. Below, she watched the motion of the
      bush-tops where the shrubbery was parted by the progress of his sturdy
      body down the long slope.

      V. &mdash; AN UPHOLDER OF TRADITIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day passes much like another in Caracuna City. The sun rises blandly,
      grows hot and angry as it climbs the slippery polished vault of the
      heavens, and coasts down to its rest in a pleased and mild glow. From the
      squat cathedral tower the bells clang and jangle defiance to the
      Adversary, temporarily drowning out the street tumult in which the yells
      of the lottery venders, the braying of donkeys, the whoops of the cabmen,
      and the blaring of the little motor cars with big horns, combine to render
      Caracuna the noisiest capital in the world. Through the saddle-colored
      hordes on the moot ground of the narrow sidewalks moves an occasional
      Anglo-Saxon resident, browned and sallowed, on his way to the government
      concession that he manages; a less occasional Anglo-Saxoness, browned and
      marked with the seal that the tropics put upon every woman who braves
      their rigors for more than a brief period; and a sprinkling of tourists in
      groups, flying on cheek, brow, and nose the stark red of their newness to
      the climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not of this sorority Miss Polly Brewster. Having blithe regard to her duty
      as an ornament of this dull world, she had tempered the sun to the foreign
      cuticle with successively diminishing layers of veils, to such good
      purpose that the celestial scorcher had but kissed her graduated brownness
      to a soft glow of color. Not alone in appreciation of her external
      advantages was Miss Brewster. Such as it was,&mdash;and it had its
      qualities, albeit somewhat unformulated,&mdash;Caracuna society gave her
      prompt welcome. There were teas and rides and tennis at the little club;
      there were agreeable, presentable men and hospitable women; and always
      there was Fitzhugh Carroll, suave, handsome, gentle, a polished man of the
      world among men, a courteous attendant to every woman, but always with a
      first thought for her. Was it sheer perversity of character, that elfin
      perversity so shrewdly divined by the hermit of the mountain, that put in
      her mind, in this far corner of the world, among these strange people, the
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All men are alike, and Fitz, for all that he's so different and the best
      of them, is the MOST alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which paradox, being too much for her in the heat of the day, she put
      aside in favor of the insinuating thought of her beetle man. Whatever else
      he might or might not be, he wasn't alike. She was by no means sure that
      she found this difference either admirable or amiable. But at least it was
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, she was piqued. For four days had passed and the recluse had not
      returned her call. True, there had come to her hotel a wicker full of
      superb wild tree blooms, and, again, a tiny box, cunning in workmanship of
      scented wood, containing what at first glance she had taken to be a jewel,
      until she saw that it was a tiny butterfly with opalescent wings, mounted
      on a silver wire. But with them had come no word or token of
      identification. Perhaps they weren't from the queer and remote person at
      all. Very likely Mr. Raimonda had sent them; or Fitzhugh Carroll was
      adding secret attention to his open homage; or they might even be a
      further peace offering from the Hochwald secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      That occasionally too festive diplomat had, indeed, made amends both
      profound and, evidently, sincere. Soliciting the kind offices of both
      Sherwen and Raimonda, he had presented himself, under their escort, stiff
      and perspiring in his full official regalia, before Mr. Brewster; then
      before his daughter, whose solemnity, presently breaking down before his
      painfully rehearsed English, dissolved in fluent French, setting him at
      ease and making him her slave. Poor penitent Von Plaanden even apologized
      to Carroll, fortunately not having heard of the American's threat, and
      made a most favorable impression upon that precisian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Intoxicated, he may be a rough, Miss Polly," Carroll confided to the
      girl. "But sober, the man is a gentleman. He feels very badly about the
      whole affair. Offered to your father to report it all through official
      channels and attach his resignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for worlds!" cried Miss Polly. "The poor man was half asleep. And Mr.
      Bee&mdash;Mr. Perkins DID jog him rather sharply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Von Plaanden asked my advice as an American about his attitude
      toward Cluff and Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you told him to let the whole thing drop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly what I did. I explained about Cluff; that he was a very good
      fellow, but of a different class, and probably wouldn't give the thing
      another thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Perkins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Von Plaanden wanted to challenge him, if he could find him. I suggested
      that he leave me to deal with Mr. Perkins. After some discussion, he
      agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! And what are you going to do with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find him first, if I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you where." Carroll stared at her, astonished. "But I don't
      think I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He announced his intention of keeping out of my way. The man has no sense
      of shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You probably scared the poor lamb out of his wits, fire-eater that you
      are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll would have liked to think so, but an innate sense of justice
      beneath his crust of prejudice forbade him to accept this judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The strange part of it is that he doesn't impress me as being afraid. But
      there is certainly something very wrong with the fellow. A man who will
      deliberately desert a woman in distress"&mdash;Carroll's manner expanded
      into the roundly rhetorical&mdash;"whatever else he may be, cannot be a
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There might have been mitigating circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No circumstances could excuse such an action. And, after that, the fellow
      had the effrontery to send you a message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? What was it?" asked Miss Polly quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I didn't let him finish. I forbade his even mentioning your
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried the girl, in quick dudgeon. "Don't you think you are
      taking a great deal upon yourself, Fitz? What do you really know about Mr.
      Perkins, anyway, that you judge him so offhandedly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very little, but enough, I think. And I hardly think you know more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you're wrong. I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You KNOW this man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does your father approve of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind my father! He has confidence enough in me to let me judge of
      my own friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends?" Carroll's handsome face clouded and reddened. "If I had known
      that he was a friend of yours, Miss Polly, I never would have spoken as I
      did. I'm most sincerely sorry," he added, with grave courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's color deepened under the brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't exactly a friend," she admitted. "I've just met and talked with
      him a few times. But your judgment seemed so unfair, on such a slight
      basis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I can't reverse my judgment," said the Southerner stiffly, "But
      I know of only one standard for those matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just your trouble." Her eyes took on a cold gleam as she scanned
      the perfection and finish of the man before her. "Fitzhugh, do you wear
      ready-made clothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," he answered, in surprise at this turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your suits are all made to order?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your shirts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and shoes, and various other things." He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you have them specially made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beeause they suit me better, and I can afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's really because you want them individualized for you, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why do you always get your mental clothes ready-made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I understand, Miss Polly," he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me that all your ideas and estimates and standards are of
      stock pattern," she explained relentlessly. "Inside, you're as just
      exactly so as a pair of wooden shoes. Can't you see that you can't judge
      all men on the same plane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that you're angry with me, and I see that I'm being punished for
      what I said about&mdash;about Mr. Perkins. If I'd known that you took any
      interest in him, I'd have bitten my tongue in two before speaking as I
      did. As for the message, if you wish it, I'll go to him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that doesn't matter," she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This much I can say, in honesty," continued the Southerner, with an
      effort: "I had a talk, almost an encounter, with him in the plaza, and I
      don't believe he is the coward I thought him."
    </p>
    <p>
      His intent to be fair to the object of his scorn was so genuine that his
      critic felt a swift access of compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Fitz," she said sweetly, "you're not to blame. I should have told
      you. And you're honest and loyal and a gentleman. Only I wish sometimes
      that you weren't quite so awfully gentlemanly a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Southerner made a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only understand you, Miss Polly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hope it. I've never yet understood myself. But there's a sympathy
      in me for the under dog, and this Mr. Perkins seems a sort of helpless
      creature. Yet in another way he doesn't seem helpless at all. Quite the
      reverse. Oh, dear! I'm tired of Perkins, Perkins, Perkins! Let's talk
      about something pleasanter&mdash;like the plague."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that about Perkins?" Galpy had entered the drawing-room where the
      conversation had been carried on, and now crossed over to them. "I'll tell
      you a good one on the little blighteh. D' you know what they call him at
      the Club Amicitia since his adventure on the street car, Miss Brewster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Unspeakable Perk.' Rippin', ain't it? Like 'The Unspeakable Turk,'
      you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite herself, Polly's lips twitched; in some ways he WAS unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've nicknamed him that because of his trying to help me, and then&mdash;leaving?"
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not entirely. There's other things. He's a nahsty, stand-offish way
      with him, you know. Don't-want-to-know-yeh trick.
      Wouldn't-speak-to-yeh-if-I-could-help-it twist to his face. 'The
      Unspeakable Perk.' Stands him right, I should say. There's other reasons,
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw a quick, warning frown on Carroll's sharply turned face. Galpy
      noted it, too, and was lost in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;just gossip&mdash;nothing at all. I say, Miss Brewster,
      the railway&mdash;I'm in the Ferrocarril-del-Norte office, you know&mdash;has
      offered your party a special on an hour's notice, any time you want it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's most kind of your road, Mr. Galpy. But why should we want it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things might be getting a bit ticklish any day now. I've just taken the
      message from the manager to your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman took his leave, and Polly Brewster went to her room,
      to freshen up for luncheon, carrying with her the sobriquet she had just
      heard. Certainly, applied to its subject, it had a mucilaginous
      consistency. It stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Unspeakable Perk,'" she repeated, with a little chuckle. "If I had a
      month to train him in, eh, what a speakable Perk I'd make him! I'd make
      him into a Perk that would sit up and speak when I lifted my little
      finger." She considered this. "I'm not so sure," she concluded, more
      doubtfully. "How can one tell through those horrid glasses, particularly
      when one doesn't see him for days and days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without moving, she might, however, have seen him forthwith, for at that
      precise and particular moment, the Unspeakable Perk was in plain sight of
      her window, on a bench in the corner of the plaza, engaged in light
      conversation with a legless and philosophical beggar whom he had just
      astonished by the presentation of a whole bolivar, of the value of twenty
      cents gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had finished luncheon and returned to her room, he was still
      there. Not until the mid-heat of the afternoon, however, did she observe,
      first with puzzlement, then with a start of recognition, the patiently
      rounded brown back of the forward-leaning figure in the corner. Greatly
      wroth was Miss Polly Brewster. For some hours&mdash;two, at least&mdash;the
      man to keep tryst and wager with whom she had tramped up miles of mountain
      road had been in town and hadn't called upon her! Truly was he an
      Unspeakable Perk!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't there possibly a mistake somewhere, though? A second peep at the
      far-away back interpreted into the curve a suggestion of resigned waiting.
      Maybe he had called, after all. Thought being usually with Miss Brewster
      the mother of the twins, Determination and Action, she slipped downstairs
      and inquired of the three guardians of the door, in such Spanish as she
      could muster, whether a Mr. Perkins, wearing large glasses&mdash;this in
      the universal sign manual&mdash;had been to see her that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, Senorita"&mdash;he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, then, hadn't his name been brought to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Extended hands and up-shrugged shoulders that might mean either apology or
      incomprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straightway Miss Brewster pinned a hat upon her brown head at an
      altogether casual and heart-distracting angle and sallied down into the
      tesselated bowl of the park. Quite unconscious of her approach, until she
      was close upon him, her objective chatted fluently with the legless one,
      until she spoke quietly, almost in his ear. Then it was only by a clutch
      at the bench back that he saved himself from disaster on his return to
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;what&mdash;wh&mdash;where&mdash;how did you come here?"
      he stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, now, don't be alarmed," she admonished. "Shut your eyes, draw a deep
      breath, count three. And, as soon as you are ready I'll give you a
      talisman against social panic. Are you ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Y-yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Whenever I come upon you suddenly, you mustn't try to jump up
      into a tree as you did just now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. Or burrow under a rock, as you did the other day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss B-B-Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait until I've finished. You must turn your thoughts firmly upon your
      science, until you've recovered equilibrium and the power of human
      speech."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when you jump at me that way, I c-c-can't think of anything but you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's where the charm comes in. As soon as you see me or hear me
      approaching, you must repeat, quite slowly, this scientific incantation."
      She beat time with a pink and rhythmic finger as she chanted:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Scarab, tarantula, doodle-bug, flea."
</pre>
    <p>
      The beggar rapidly made the sign that protects one from the influence of
      the malign and supernatural. The scientist scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Repeat it!" she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no such insect as a doodle-bug," he protested feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there? I thought I heard you mention it in your conversation with
      Mr. Carroll the other night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You put that into my head," he accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly? Then life is indeed real and earnest. To have introduced something
      unscientific into that compendium of science&mdash;there's triumph enough
      for any ambition. Besides, see how beautifully it scans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she beat time, and again the beggar crooked defensive fingers as she
      declaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "SCAR-ab, tar-ANT-u-la, DOO-dle-bug, FLEA!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Homeric, I call it. Perhaps you think you could improve on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind substituting 'neuropter' in the third strophe?" he
      ventured. "It would be just as good as 'doodle-bug,' and more&mdash;more
      accurate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's a neuropter? You didn't make him up for the occasion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid! The dragon-fly is a neuropter. The dragon-fly we're going
      to breed to a biplane, you know," he reminded her slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Well, I shall stick to my doodle-bug. He's more euphonious. Now,
      repeat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me off this time," he pleaded. "I'm all right&mdash;quite recovered.
      It's only at the start that it's so bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she agreed. "But you're not to forget it. And next time we
      meet you're to be sure and say it over until you're sane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sane!" he said resentfully. "I'm as sane as any one you know. It's the
      job of KEEPING sane in this madhouse of the tropics that's almost driven
      me crazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely!" she approved. "Well, now that you've recovered, I'll tell you
      what I came out to say. I'm sorry that I missed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missed me?" he repeated. "Oh, you have missed me, then? That's nice. You
      see, I've been so busy for the last three or four days&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I haven't missed you a bit," she declared indignantly. "The conceit
      of the man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you said you w-w-were sorry you'd&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be wholly a beetle! I meant I was sorry not to see you when you
      came to call on me this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't come to call on you this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? The boy at the door said he'd seen you, or something answering to
      your description."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he did. I came to see your father. He was out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From eleven on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father? No, I don't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His secretary came down and told me so, or sent word each time."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled pityingly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. That's what a secretary is for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To tell lies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White lies. You see, dad is a very busy man, and an important man, and
      many people come to see him whom he hasn't time to see. So, unless he knew
      your business, he would naturally be 'out' to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The corners of the young man's rather sensitive mouth flattened out
      perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see. My mistake. Living in countries where, however queer the
      people may be, they at least observe ordinary human courtesies, one
      forgets&mdash;if one ever knew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you want of dad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, to borrow four dollars of him, of course," he replied dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be angry at me. You see, dad's time is valuable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed? To whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to himself, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, my time&mdash;However, that doesn't matter. I haven't wholly
      wasted it." He glanced toward the beggar, who was profoundly regarding the
      cathedral clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like, I'll get you an interview with dad," she offered
      magnanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? No, I thank you," he said crisply. "I'm not patient of unnecessary
      red tape."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brewster looked at him in surprise. It was borne in upon her, as she
      looked, that this man was not accustomed to being lightly regarded by
      other men, however busy or important; that his own concerns in life were
      quite as weighty to him, and in his esteem, perhaps, to others, as were
      the interests of any magnate; and that, man to man, there would be no
      shyness or indecision or purposelessness anywhere in his make-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it was important," she began hesitantly, "my father would be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was of no importance to me," he cut in. "To others&mdash;Perhaps I
      could see some one else of your party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here I am." She smiled. "Why won't I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the obscuring disks she could feel his glance read her. The
      grimness at the mouth's corners relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know why you shouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad says I'd have made a man of affairs," she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it's just this. You should be planning to leave this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Brewster bewailed her harsh lot with drooping lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one wants to drive me away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That railroad man, Mr. Galpy, was offering us special inducements to
      leave, in the form of special trains any time we liked. It isn't
      hospitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A jail is hospitable. But one doesn't stay in it when one can get out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Caracuna were the jail and I the 'one,' one might. I quite love it
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sharp gesture of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be childish," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Childish? You come down like Freedom from the mountain heights, and
      unfurl your warnings to the air, and complain of lost time and all that
      sort of thing, and what does it all amount to?" she demanded, with spirit.
      "That we should sail away, when you know perfectly well that the Dutch
      won't let us sail away! Childish, indeed! Don't you be BEETLISH!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a way out, without much risk, but some discomfort. You could
      strike south-east to the Bird Reefs, take a small boat, and get over to
      the mainland. As soon as the blockade is off, the yacht can take your
      luggage around. The trip would be rough for you, but not dangerous. Not as
      dangerous as staying here may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think it so serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most emphatically."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come with us and show us the way?" she inquired, gazing with
      exaggerated appeal into his goggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pins through scarabs," she laughed, "while beneath you Caracuna riots and
      revolutes and massacres foreigners. Nero with his fiddle was nothing to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Brewster, I'm afraid you are suffering from a misplaced sense of
      humor. Will you believe me when I tell you that I have certain sources of
      information in local matters both serviceable and reliable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have bet on a certainty in the Dutch blockade matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's equally certain that there is bubonic plague here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bola. You told me so yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps there was nothing to be gained then by letting you know, as you
      were bottled up, with no way out. Now, through the good offices of a
      foreign official, who, of course, couldn't afford to appear, this
      opportunity to reach the mainland is open to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you anything to do with that?" she inquired suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the official is a friend of mine," he answered carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you really believe that there is an epidemic of plague here? Don't
      you think that I'd make a good Red Cross nurse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was grave and rather stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never seen bubonic plague," he said, "or you wouldn't joke about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry. But it wasn't wholly a joke. If we were really cooped up with
      an epidemic, I'd volunteer. What else would there be to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the sort," he cried vehemently. "You don't know what you're
      talking about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, isn't the wonderful Luther Pruyn on his way to exorcise the
      demon, or something of the sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Luther Pruyn? Who says he's coming here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the gossip of the diplomatic set and the clubs. He's the favorite
      mystery of the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if he does come, it won't improve matters any, for the first case
      he verifies he'll clap on a quarantine that a mouse couldn't creep
      through. I know something of the Pruyn method."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't wholly approve it, I judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be efficacious, but it's extremely inconvenient at times."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the cathedral clock boomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how I've kept you from your own affairs!" cried Miss Polly
      contritely. "What are you going to do now? Go back to your mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. As soon as you tell me that your father will go out by the reefs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you expect him to make up his mind, on five minutes' notice, to
      abandon his yacht?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought great magnates were supposed to be men of instant and
      unalterable decisions. I don't know the type."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, dad has gone out. I saw him drive away. Wouldn't to-morrow do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes; I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you. The Voice will report at the rock to-morrow, at four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a very uncompromising 'no'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't be there at four. Make it five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a very arbitrary beetle man! Well, as I've wasted so much of your
      time to-day, I'll accept your orders for to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And please impress your father with the extreme advisability of your
      getting off this island."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," she said meekly. "You'll be most awfully glad to get rid of
      us, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very greatly relieved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a little bit sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The begoggled face turned toward her. There was a perceptible tensity in
      the line of the jaw. But the beetle man made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, if I could see behind those glasses," said Miss Polly Brewster to
      her wicked little self, "I'd probably BITE myself rather than say it
      again. Just the same&mdash;And a little bit sorry?" she persisted aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that matter?" said the man quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Polly Brewster forthwith bit herself on her pink and wayward tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think I'm not grateful," she employed that chastened member to say.
      "I am, most deeply. So will father be, even if he decides not to leave.
      I'm afraid that's what he will decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He mustn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him that yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, if it becomes necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me be present at the interview. Most people are afraid of dad.
      Perhaps you'd be, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could always run away," he remarked, unsmiling. "You know how well I do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must do it now myself, and get arrayed for the daily tea sacrifice. Au
      revoir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hasta manana," he said absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned to go, but at the word she came slowly back a pace or two,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a strange beetle man you are!" she said softly. "I have no other
      friends like you. You ARE a friend, aren't you, in your queer way?" She
      did not wait for an answer, but went on: "You don't come to see me when I
      ask you. You don't send me any word. You make me feel that, compared to
      your concerns with beetles and flies, I'm quite hopelessly unimportant.
      And yet here I find you giving up your own pursuits and wasting your time
      to plan and watch and think for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you," he corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me," she accepted sweetly. "What an ungrateful little pig you must
      think me! But truly inside I appreciate it and thank you, and I think&mdash;I
      feel that perhaps it amounts to a lot more than I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No great thing," he said. "But it's the best I can do, anyway. Do you
      remember what the mediaeval mummer said, when he came bearing his poor
      homage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Tell it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It runs like this: 'Lady, who art nowise bitter to those who serve you
      with a good intent, that which thy servant is, that he is for you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly Brewster," said the girl to herself, as she walked, slowly and
      musingly, back to her room, "the busy haunts of men are more suited to
      your style than the free-and-untrammeled spaces of nature, and well you
      know it. But you'll go to-morrow and you'll keep on going until you find
      out what is behind those brown-green goblin spectacles. If only he didn't
      look so like a gnome!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clause conditional, introduced by the word "if," does not always imply
      a conclusion, even in the mind of the propounder. Miss Brewster would have
      been hard put to it to round out her subjunctive.

      VI. &mdash; FORKED TONGUES
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said Thatcher Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher Brewster's "Pooh!" is generally recognized in the realm of high
      finance as carrying weight. It is not derisive or contemptuous; it is
      dismissive. The subject of it simply ceases to exist. In the present
      instance, it was so mild as scarcely to stir the smoke from his
      after-dinner cigar, yet it had all the intent, if not the effect, of
      finality. The reason why it hadn't the effect was that it was directed at
      Thatcher Brewster's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not quite so much 'Pooh!' as you think," was that damsel's
      reception of the pregnant monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bug-hunter from nowhere! Don't I know that type?" said the magnate, who
      confounded all scientists with inventors, the capital-seeking inventor
      being the bane and torment of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew about the Dutch blockade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or pretended he did. I'm afraid my Pollipet has let herself romanticize a
      little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Romanticize!" The girl laughed. "If you could see him, dad! Romance and
      my poor little beetle man don't live in the same world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the realm of memory, where the echoes come and go by no known law,
      sounded his voice in her ear: "'That which thy servant is, that he is for
      you.'" Dim doubt forthwith began to cloud the bright certainty of Miss
      Brewster's verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's gone to all the trouble that I told you of, it must be that he
      has some good reason for wanting to get us safely out," she argued to her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he feels that his peace of mind would be more assured if you were
      in some other country," he teased. "No, my dear, I'm not leaving a
      full-manned yacht in a foreign harbor and smuggling myself out of a
      friendly country on the say-so of an unknown adviser, whose chief ability
      seems to lie in the hundred-yard dash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that's unfair and ungrateful. If a man with a sword&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I begin a row, I stay with it," said Mr. Brewster grimly. "Quitters
      and I don't pull well together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm to tell him 'No'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so positively at all. I shall say, 'No, thank you,' in my very nicest
      way, and say that you're very grateful and appreciative and not at all the
      growly old bear of a dad that you pretend to be when one doesn't know and
      love you. And perhaps I'll invite him to dine here and go away on the
      yacht with us&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And graciously accept a couple of hundred thousand dollars bonus, and
      come into the company as first vice-president," chuckled her father. "And
      then he'll wake up and find he's been sitting on a cactus. See here," he
      added, with a sharpening of tone, "do you suppose he could get a cablegram
      for transmission to Washington over to the mainland for us by this
      mysterious route of his?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're really sure you want to go, Pollipet? This is your cruise, you
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Miss Polly had been declaring to all and sundry, including the
      beetle man himself, that it was her firm intent and pleasure to stay on
      the island and observe the presumptively interesting events that promised.
      That she had reversed this decision, on the unsolicited counsel of an
      extremely queer stranger, was a phenomenon the peculiarity of which did
      not strike her at the time. All that she felt was a settled confidence in
      the beetle man's sound reason for his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said Mr. Brewster. "If I can get through a message to the
      State Department, they'll bring pressure to bear on the Dutch, and we can
      take the yacht through the blockade. It's only a question of finding a way
      to lay the matter before the Dutch authorities, anyway. I've been making
      inquiries here, and I find there's no intention of bottling up neutral
      pleasure craft. I dare say we could get out now. Only it's possible that
      the Hollanders might shoot first and ask questions afterward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have to be done quickly, dad. They may quarantine at any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Pruyn ought to be here any day now. Let's leave that matter for him.
      There's a man I have confidence in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Perkins says that Dr. Pruyn will bottle up the port tighter than the
      Dutch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him, so long as we get out first. Now, Polly, you tell this man
      Perkins that I'll pay all expenses and give him a round hundred for
      himself if he'll bring me a receipt showing that my cablegram has been
      dispatched to Washington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I'd quite like to do that, dad. He isn't the sort of man
      one offers money to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one's the sort of man one offers money to&mdash;if it's enough,"
      retorted her father. "And a hundred dollars will look pretty big to a
      scientific man. I know something about their salaries. You try him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as expenses go, I will. But I won't hurt his feelings by trying to
      pay him for something that he would do for friendship or not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have it your own way. When is he coming in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't coming in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then where are you going to see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up on the mountain trail, when I ride tomorrow afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Carroll?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I'm going alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite like to have you knocking about mountain roads by yourself,
      though Mr. Sherwen says you're safe anywhere here. Where's that little
      automatic revolver I gave you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my trunk. I'll carry that if it will make you feel any easier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do. But I can't see why you can't send word to Perkins that I want
      to see him here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can. And I can guess just what his answer would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, guess ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd tell you to go to the bad place, or its scientific equivalent." She
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would he?" Mr. Brewster did not laugh. "And perhaps you'll be good enough
      to tell me why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you sent word that you were out when he called."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! I see people when <i>I</i> want to see THEM, not when they want to
      see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Mr. Perkins is likely to prove permanently invisible to you, if I'm
      any judge of character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said Mr. Brewster impatiently, "manage it yourself. Only
      impress on him the necessity of getting the message on the wire. I'll
      write it out to-night and give it to you with the money to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon on the following day, Polly, with the cablegram and money
      in her purse and her automatic safely disposed in her belt, walked in the
      plaza with Carroll. The legless beggar whined at them for alms. Handing
      him a quartillo, the Southerner would have passed on, but his companion
      stood eyeing the mendicant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what can there be in that poor wreck to captivate the scientific
      intellect?" she marveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you mean Mr. Perkins&mdash;" began Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think perhaps the reason for some of that gentleman's associations
      will hardly stand inquiry."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned her eyes on him and searched the handsome, serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fitz, you're not the man to say that of another man without some good
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think that Mr. Perkins is not the kind of man for me to have anything
      to do with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I'm afraid he isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think that, having gone so far, you ought to tell me why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather tell your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you implying a scandal in connection with my timid, little dried-up
      scientist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm only saying," said the other doggedly, "that there's something secret
      and underhanded about that place of his in the mountains. It's a matter of
      common gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor beetle man! Why, he's so afraid of a woman that he goes all to
      pieces if one speaks to him suddenly. Just to see his expression, I'd like
      to tell him that he's being scandalized by all Caracuna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're going to see him again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. This afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you should, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any actual facts against him? Anything but casual gossip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have, I'll listen to you. But you couldn't make me believe it,
      anyway. Why, Fitz, look at him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me with you," insisted the other, "and let me ask him a question or
      two that any honorable man could answer. They don't call him the
      Unspeakable Perk for nothing, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just because they don't understand his type. Nor do you, Fitz, and
      so you mistrust him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand that you've shown more interest in him than in any one you
      know," said the other miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her laugh rang as free and frank as a child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Interest? That's true. But if you mean sentiment, Fitz, after once having
      looked into the depths of those absurd goggles, can you, COULD you think
      of sentiment and the beetle man in the same breath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I couldn't," he confessed, relieved. "But, then, I never have been
      able to understand you, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therein lies my fatal charm," she said saucily. "Now, to the beetle man,
      I'm a specimen. HE understands as much as he wants to. Probably I shall
      never see him after to-day, anyway. He's going to get a message through
      for us that will deliver us from this land of bondage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't do it&mdash;too soon for me," declared Carroll. "And, Miss
      Polly, you don't think the worse of me for having said behind his back
      what I'm just waiting to say to his face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said the girl warmly. "Only I know it's nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Carroll, quite honestly. "I would hate to think anything
      low-down of a man you'd call your friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll had learned more than he had told, but less than enough to give
      him what he considered proper evidence to lay before Polly's father. After
      some deliberation as to the point of honor involved, he decided to go to
      Raimonda, who, alone in Caracuna City, seemed to be on personal terms with
      the hermit. He found the young man in his office. With entire frankness,
      Carroll stated his errand and the reason for it. The Caracunan heard him
      with grave courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, senior," concluded the American, "here's my question, and it's
      for you to determine whether, under the circumstances, you are justified
      in giving me an answer. Is there a woman living in Mr. Perkins's quinta on
      the mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot answer that question," said the other, after some deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry," said Carroll simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I also. The more so in that my attitude may be misconstrued against Mr.
      Perkins. I am bound by confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I infer," returned his visitor courteously. "Then I have only to ask
      your pardon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, if you please, senor. Perhaps this will serve to make easy
      your mind. On my word, there is nothing in Mr. Perkins's life on the
      mountain in any manner dishonorable or&mdash;or irregular."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash, the simple solution crossed Carroll's mind. That a woman was
      there, and a woman not of the servant class, could hardly be doubted, in
      view of almost direct evidence from eyewitnesses. If there was nothing
      irregular about her presence, it was because she was Perkins's wife. In
      view of Raimonda's attitude, he did not feel free to put the direct query.
      Another question would serve his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it advisable, and for the best interests of Miss Brewster, that she
      should associate with him under the circumstances?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Caracunan started and shot a glance at his interlocutor that said, as
      plainly as words, "How much do you know that you are not telling?" had the
      latter not been too intent upon his own theory to interpret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that," said Raimonda, after a pause,&mdash;"that is another question.
      If it were my sister, or any one dear to me&mdash;but"&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;"views
      on that matter differ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly think that yours and mine differ, senior. I thank you for
      bearing with me with so much patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out with his suspicions hardened into certainty.

    <h2>
      VII. &mdash; "THAT WHICH THY SERVANT IS&mdash;"
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man that you'd call your friend. Such had been Fitzhugh Carroll's
      reference to the Unspeakable Perk. With that characterization in her mind.
      Miss Brewster let herself drift, after her suitor had left her, into a
      dreamy consideration of the hermit's attitude toward her. She was not
      prone lightly to employ the terms of friendship, yet this new and casual
      acquaintance had shown a readiness to serve&mdash;not as cavalier, but as
      friend&mdash;none too common in the experience of the much-courted and a
      little spoiled beauty. Being, indeed, a "lady nowise bitter to those who
      served her with good intent," she reflected, with a kindly light in her
      eyes, that it was all part and parcel of the beetle's man's amiable
      queerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still musing upon this queerness, she strolled back to find her mount
      waiting at the corner of the plaza. In consideration of the heat she let
      her cream-colored mule choose his own pace, so they proceeded quite slowly
      up the hill road, both absorbed in meditation, which ceased only when the
      mule started an argument about a turn in the trail. He was a well-bred
      trotting mule, worth six hundred dollars in gold of any man's money, and
      he was self-appreciative in knowledge of the fact. He brought a singular
      firmness of purpose to the support of the negative of her proposition,
      which was that he should swing north from the broad into the narrow path.
      When the debate was over, St. John the Baptist&mdash;this, I hesitate to
      state, yet must, it being the truth, was the spirited animal's name&mdash;was
      considerably chastened, and Miss Brewster more than a trifle flushed. She
      left him tied to a ceiba branch at the exit from the dried creek bed, with
      strict instructions not to kick, lest a worse thing befall him. Miss
      Brewster's fighting blood was up, when, ten minutes late, because of the
      episode, she reached the summit of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Beetle Man, are you there?" she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Voice. You sound strange. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been hurrying, and if you tell me I'm late, I'll&mdash;I'll fall on
      your neck again and break it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has anything happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing in particular. I've been boxing the compass with a mule. It's
      tiresome."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not, by any chance, speaking figuratively of your respected
      parent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly NOT!" she disclaimed indignantly. "This was a real mule. You're
      very impertinent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, he was impertinent to me, saying he was out when he was
      in. What is his decision&mdash;yes or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp exclamation came from the nook below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the entomological synonym for 'damn'?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lament for time wasted on a&mdash;Well, never mind that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he wants you to carry a message by that secret route of yours. Will
      you do it for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "NO!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not being a very kind or courteous beetle man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I owe Mr. Brewster no courtesy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you pay only where you owe? Just, but hardly amiable. Well, you owe
      me nothing&mdash;but&mdash;will you do it for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without even knowing what it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In return you shall have your heart's desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't the dearest wish of your soul to drive me out of Caracuna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum! Well&mdash;er&mdash;yes. Yes; of course it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. If you can get dad's message on the wire to Washington, he
      thinks the Secretary of State, who is his friend, can reach the Dutch and
      have them open up the blockade for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time apparently meaning nothing to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it take much time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About four days to a wire."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you were willing to give up four days to carry my message through,
      'unsight&mdash;unseen,' as we children used to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willing enough, but not able to. I'd have got a messenger through with
      it, if necessary. But in four days, there'll be other obstacles besides
      the Dutch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarantine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that had to wait for Dr. Pruyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pruyn's here. That's a secret, Miss Brewster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know EVERYTHING? Has he found plague?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I don't say that. But he will find it, for it's certainly here. I
      satisfied myself of that yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From your beggar friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What made you think that, O most acute observer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else would you be talking to him of, with such interest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're correct. Bubonic always starts in the poor quarters. To know how
      people die, you have to know how they live. So I cultivated my beggar
      friend and listened to the gossip of quick funerals and unexplained
      disappearances. I'd have had some real arguments to present to Mr.
      Brewster if he had cared to listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll listen to Dr. Pruyn. They're old friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Since college days. So perhaps the quarantine will be easier to get
      through than the blockade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so? I'm afraid you'll find that pull doesn't work with the
      service that Dr. Pruyn is in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think that there will be quarantine within four days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost sure to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, of course, I needn't trouble you with the message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't jump at conclusions. There might be another and quicker way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wireless?" she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wireless on the island. No. This way you'll just have to trust me
      for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll trust you for anything you say you can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't say I can. I say only that I'll try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough for me. Ready! Now, brace yourself. I'm coming down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wh&mdash;why&mdash;wait! Can't you send it down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Besides, you KNOW you want to see me. No use pretending, after last
      time. Remember your verse now, and I'll come slowly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Solemnly he began:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         "Scarab, tarantula, neurop&mdash;"
    "'Doodle-bug,'" she prompted severely.
            "&mdash;doodle-bug, flea,"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      he concluded obediently.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Scarab, tarantula, doodle-bug, flea.
     Scarab, tarantula, doodle&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oof! I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't think you'd be here so soon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He scrambled to his feet, hardly less palpitating than on the occasion of
      their first encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hopeless!" she mourned. "Incurable! Wanted: a miracle of St. Vitus. Do
      stop nibbling your hat, and sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it's as bad as it was," he murmured, obeying. "One gets
      accustomed to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One gets accustomed to anything in time, even the eccentricities of one's
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I'm eccentric?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I think&mdash;Have you ever known any one who didn't think you
      eccentric?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this he pondered solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so long since I've stopped to consider what people think of me. One
      hasn't time, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then one is unhuman. <i>I</i> have time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. But you haven't anything else to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      As this was quite true, she naturally felt annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowing as you do all the secrets of my inner life," she observed
      sarcastically, "of course you are in a position to judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own words recalled Carroll's charge, and though, with the subject of
      them before her, it seemed ridiculously impossible, yet the spirit of
      mischief, ever hovering about her like an attendant sprite, descended and
      took possession of her speech. She assumed a severely judicial expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man, will you lay your hand upon your microscope, or whatever
      else scientists make oath upon, and answer fully and truly the question
      about to be put to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I hope for a blessed release from this abode of lunacy, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man, have you got an awful secret in your life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So sharply did he start that the heavy goggles slipped a fraction of an
      inch along his nose, the first time she had ever seen them in any degree
      misplaced. She was herself sensibly discountenanced by his perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you ask that?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Natural interest in a friend," she answered lightly, but with growing
      wonder. "I think you'd be altogether irresistible if you were a pirate or
      a smuggler or a revolutionary. The romantic spirit could lurk so securely
      behind those gloomy soul-screens that you wear. What do you keep back of
      them, O dark and shrouded beetle man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My eyes," he grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Basilisk eyes, I'm sure. And what behind the eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly keep them securely. No intruders allowed. But you haven't
      answered my question. Have you ever murdered any one in cold blood? Or are
      you a married man trifling with the affections of poor little me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall know all," he began, in the leisurely tone of one who commences
      a long narrative. "My parents were honest, but poor. At the age of three
      years and four months, a maternal uncle, who, having been a proofreader of
      Abyssinian dialect stories for a ladies' magazine, was considered a
      literary prophet, foretold that I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help! Wait! Stop!&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'Oh, skip your dear uncle!' the bellman exclaimed,
    And impatiently tinkled his bell."
</pre>
    <p>
      Her companion promptly capped her verse:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'I skip forty years,' said the baker in tears,"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      "You can't," she objected. "If you skipped half that, I don't believe it
      would leave you much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When one is giving one's life history by request," he began, with
      dignity, "interruptions&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't by request," she protested. "I don't want your life history. I
      won't have it! You shan't treat an unprotected and helpless stranger so.
      Besides, I'm much more interested to know how you came to be familiar with
      Lewis Carroll."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just because I've wasted my career on frivolous trifles like science, you
      needn't think I've wholly neglected the true inwardness of life, as
      exemplified in 'The Hunting of the Snark,'" he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know"&mdash;she leaned forward, searching his face&mdash;"I
      believe you came out of that book yourself. ARE you a Boojum? Will you,
      unless I 'charm you with smiles and soap,'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      "'Softly and silently vanish away,
        And never be heard of again'?"
</pre>
    <p>
      "You're mixed. YOU'D be the one to do that if I were a real Boojum. And
      you'll be doing it soon enough, anyway," he concluded ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I shall, but don't be too sure that I'll 'never be heard of again.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up at the sun, which was edging behind a dark cloud, over the
      gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your raging thirst for personal information sufficiently slaked?" he
      asked. "We've still fifteen or twenty minutes left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all? And I haven't yet given you the message!" She drew it from
      the bag and handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sealed," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl colored painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad didn't intend&mdash;You mustn't think&mdash;" With a flash of
      generous wrath she tore the envelope open and held out the inclosure. "But
      I shouldn't have thought you so concerned with formalities," she commented
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't that. But in some respects, possibly important, it would be
      better if&mdash;" He stopped, looking at her doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it," she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran through the brief document.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it's just as well that I should know. I'll leave a copy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his accent made her scrutinize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're going into danger!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Danger? No; I think not. Difficulty, perhaps. But I think it can be put
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were dangerous, you'd do it just the same," she said, almost
      accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be worth some danger now to get you away from greater danger
      later. See here, Miss Brewster"&mdash;he rose and stood over her&mdash;"there
      must be no mistake or misunderstanding about this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't gloom at me with those awful glasses," she said fretfully. "I feel
      as if I were being stared at by a hidden person."
    </p>
    <p>
      He disregarded the protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I get this message through, can you guarantee that your father will
      take out the yacht as soon as the Dutch send word to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. He will do that. How are you going to deliver the message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again her words might as well not have been spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better have your luggage ready for a quick start."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it be soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How shall we know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will get word to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I fear not. This is good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're very casual about it," she said, aggrieved. "At least, it would be
      polite to pretend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I to pretend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sorry. Aren't you sorry? Just a little bit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I'm sorry. Just a little bit&mdash;at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm most awfully sorry myself," she said frankly. "I shall miss you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a curiosity?" he asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a friend. You have been a friend to us&mdash;to me," she amended
      sweetly. "Each time I see you, I have more the feeling that you've been
      more of a friend than I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That which thy servant is,'" he quoted lightly. But beneath the
      lightness she divined a pain that she could not wholly fathom. Quite aware
      of her power, Miss Polly Brewster was now, for one of the few times in her
      life, stricken with contrition for her use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I&mdash;I haven't been very nice," she faltered. "I'm afraid
      sometimes I've been quite horrid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? You've been 'the glory and the dream.' I shall be needing memories
      for a while. And when the glory has gone, at least the dream will remain&mdash;tethered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm not going to be a dream alone," she said, with wistful lightness.
      "It's far too much like being a ghost. I'm going to be a friend, if you'll
      let me. And I'm going to write to you, if you will tell me where. You
      won't find it so very easy to make a mere memory of me. And when you come
      home&mdash;When ARE you coming home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must find out, and let me know. And you must come and visit us
      at our summer place, where there's a mountain-side that we can sit on, and
      you can pretend that our lake is the Caribbean and hate it to your heart's
      content&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe I can ever quite hate the Caribbean again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From this view you mustn't, anyway. I shouldn't like that. As for our
      lake, nobody could really help loving it. So you must be sure and come,
      won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreams!" he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there room in the scientific life for dreams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But not for their fulfillment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there will be beetles and dragon-flies on our mountain," she went on,
      conscious of talking against time, of striving to put off the moment of
      departure. "You'll find plenty of work there. Do you know, Mr. Beetle Man,
      you haven't told me a thing, really, about your work, or a thing, really,
      about yourself. Is that the way to treat a friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I undertook to spread before you the true and veracious history of
      my life," he began, striving to make his tone light, "you would none of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you determined to put me off? Do you think that I wouldn't find the
      things that are real to you interesting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're quite technical," he said shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are the big things to you, aren't they? They make life for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; that, of course." It was as if he were surprised at the need of
      such a question. "I suppose I find the same excitement and adventure in
      research that other men find in politics, or war, or making money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adventure?" she said, puzzled. "I shouldn't have supposed research an
      adventurous career, exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not from the outside." His hidden gaze shifted to sweep the far
      distances. His voice dropped and softened, and, when he spoke again, she
      felt vaguely and strangely that he was hardly thinking of her or her
      question, except as a part of the great wonder-world surrounding and
      enfolding their companioned remoteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my credo," he said, and quoted, half under his breath:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'We have come in search of truth,
      Trying with uncertain key
      Door by door of mystery.
      We are reaching, through His laws,
      To the garment hem of Cause.
      As, with fingers of the blind,
      We are groping here to find
      What the hieroglyphics mean
      Of the Unseen in the seen;
      What the Thought which underlies
      Nature's masking and disguise;
      What it is that hides beneath
      Blight and bloom and birth and death.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Other men had poured poetry into Polly Brewster's ears, and she had
      thought them vapid or priggish or affected, according as they had chosen
      this or that medium. This man was different. For all his outer
      grotesquery, the noble simplicity of the verse matched some veiled and
      hitherto but half-expressed quality within him, and dignified him. Miss
      Brewster suffered the strange but not wholly unpleasant sensation of
      feeling herself dwindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very beautiful," she said, with an effort. "Is it Matthew Arnold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearer home. You an American, and don't know your Whittier? That passage
      from his 'Agassiz' comes pretty near to being what life means to me. Have
      I answered your requirements?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fully and finely."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the rock upon which she had been seated, and stretched out
      both hands to him. He took and held them without awkwardness or
      embarrassment. By that alone she could have known that he was suffering
      with a pain that submerged consciousness of self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether I see you again or not, I'll never forget you," she said softly.
      "You HAVE been good to me, Mr. Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like the other name better," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Mr. Beetle Man." She laughed a little tremulously. Abruptly
      she stamped a determined foot. "I'm NOT going away without having seen my
      friend for once. Take off your glasses, Mr. Beetle Man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too much radiance is bad for the microscopical eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun is under a cloud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're here, and you'd glow in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I'm not to be put off with pretty speeches. Take them off. Please!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Releasing her hand, he lifted off the heavy and disfiguring apparatus, and
      stood before her, quietly submissive to her wish. She took a quick step
      backward, stumbled, and thrust out a hand against the face of the giant
      rock for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she cried, and again, "Oh, I didn't think you'd look like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? Is there anything very wrong with me?" he asked seriously,
      blinking a little in the soft light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. It isn't that. I&mdash;I hardly know&mdash;I expected something
      different. Forgive me for being so&mdash;so stupid."
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Miss Polly Brewster had sustained a shock. She had become
      accustomed to regard her beetle man rather more in the light of a beetle
      than a man. In fact, the human side of him had impressed her only as a
      certain dim appeal to sympathy; the masculine side had simply not existed.
      Now it was as if he had unmasked. The visage, so grotesque and gnomish
      behind its mechanical apparatus, had given place to a wholly different and
      formidably strange face. The change all centered in the eyes. They were
      wide-set eyes of the clearest, steadiest, and darkest gray she had ever
      met; and they looked out at her from sharply angled brows with a singular
      clarity and calmness of regard. In their light the man's face became
      instinct with character in every line. Strength was there, self-control,
      dignity, a glint of humor in the little wrinkles at the corner of the
      mouth, and, withal a sort of quiet and sturdy beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had half-turned her face from him. Now, as her gaze returned and was
      fixed by his, she felt a wave of blood expand her heart, rush upward into
      her cheeks, and press into her eyes tears of swift regret. But now she was
      sorry, not for him, but for herself, because he had become remote and
      difficult to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I startled you?" he asked curiously. "I'll put them back on again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; don't do that!" She rallied herself to the point of laughing a
      little. "I'm a goose. You see, I've pictured you as quite different. Have
      you ever seen yourself in the glass with those dreadful disguises on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no; I don't suppose I have," he replied, after reflection. "After
      all, they're meant for use, not for ornament."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time she had mastered her confusion and was able to examine his
      face. Under his eyes were circles of dull gray, defined by deep lines,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you're worn out!" she cried pitifully. "Haven't you been sleeping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take something for it." The mothering instinct sprang to the
      rescue. "How much rest did you get last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see. Last night I did very well. Fully four hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is more than you average?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes; lately. You see, I've been pretty busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you've given up your time to my wretched, unimportant little stupid
      affairs! And what return have I made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've made the sun shine," he said, "in a rather shaded existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Promise me that you'll sleep to-night; that you won't work a stroke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I can't promise that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll break down. You'll go to pieces. What have you got to do more
      important than keeping in condition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, I'll last through. And there's some business that won't
      wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Divination came upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad's message!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it weren't that, it would be something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand went out to him, and was withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please put on your glasses," she said shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, he did her bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Now you are my beetle man again. No, not quite, though. You'll
      never be quite the same beetle man again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall always be," he contradicted gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyway, it's better. You're easier to say things to. Are you really the
      man who ran away from the street car?" she asked doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'm most surely sure that you had good reason." She began to laugh
      softly. "As for the stories about you, I'd believe them less than ever,
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there stories about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gossip of the club. They call you 'The Unspeakable Perk'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bad nickname," he admitted. "I expect I have been rather
      unspeakable, from their point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      A desire to have the faith that was in her supported by this man's own
      word overrode her shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beetle Man," she said, "have you got a sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? No. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you had a sister, is there anything&mdash;Oh, DARN your sister!" broke
      forth the irrepressible Polly. "I'll be your sister for this. Is there
      anything about you and your life here that you'd be afraid to tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew there wasn't," she said contentedly. She hesitated a moment, then
      put a hand on his arm. "Does this HAVE to be good-bye, Mr. Beetle Man?"
      she said wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" She stamped imperiously. "I want to see you again, and I'm going to
      see you again. Won't you come down to the port and bring me another bunch
      of your mountain orchids when we sail&mdash;just for good-bye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dull medium of the glasses she could feel his eyes questioning
      hers. And she knew that once more before she sailed away, she must look
      into those eyes, in all their clarity and all their strength&mdash;and
      then try to forget them. The swift color ran up into her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I suppose so," he said. "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Au revoir, then!" she cried, with a thrill of gladness, and fled up the
      rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unspeakable Perk strode down his path, broke into a trot, and held to
      it until he reached his house. But Miss Polly, departing in her own
      direction, stopped dead after ten minutes' going. It had struck her
      forcefully that she had forgotten the matter of the expense of the
      message. How could she reach him? She remembered the cliff above the rock,
      and the signal. If a signal was valid in one direction, it ought to work
      equally well in the other. She had her automatic with her. Retracing her
      steps, she ascended the cliff, a rugged climb. Across the deep-fringed
      chasm she could plainly see the porch of the quinta with the little
      clearing at the side, dim in the clouded light. Drawing the revolver, she
      fired three shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll come," she thought contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun broke from behind the obscuring cloud and sent a shaft of light
      straight down upon the clearing. It illumined with pitiless distinctness
      the shimmering silk of a woman's dress, hanging on a line and waving in
      the first draft of the evening breeze. For a moment Polly stood
      transfixed. What did it mean? Was it perhaps a servant's dress. No; he had
      told her that there was no woman servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sought the solution, a woman's figure emerged from the porch of the
      quinta, crossed the compound, and dropped upon a bench. Even at that
      distance, the watcher could tell from the woman's bearing and apparel that
      she was not of the servant class. She seemed to be gazing out over the
      mountains; there was something dreary and forlorn in her attitude. What,
      then, did she do in the beetle man's house?
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the rock the shrubbery weaved and thrashed, and the person who could
      best answer that question burst into view at a full lope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" he panted. "Was it you who fired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him mutely. The revolver hung in her hand. In a moment he
      was beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has anything happened?" he began again, then turned his head to follow
      the direction of her regard. He saw the figure in the compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God in heaven!" he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught the revolver from her hand and fired three slow shots. The woman
      turned. Snatching off his hat, he signalled violently with it. The woman
      rose and, as it seemed to Polly Brewster, moved in humble submissiveness
      back to the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      White consternation was stamped on the Unspeakable Perk's face as he
      handed the revolver to its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you need me?" he asked quickly. "If not, I must go back at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not need you," said the girl, in level tones. "You lied to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      His expression changed. She read in it the desperation of guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can explain," he said hurriedly, "but not now. There isn't time. Wait
      here. I'll be back. I'll be back the instant I can get away."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he was halfway down the rock, headed for the lower trail. The
      bushes closed behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painfully Polly Brewster made her way down the treacherous footing of the
      cliff path to her place on the rock. From her bag she drew one of her
      cards, wrote slowly and carefully a few words, found a dry stick, set it
      between two rocks, and pinned her message to it. Then she ran, as helpless
      humans run from the scourge of their own hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the hermit, sweat-covered and breathless, returned to
      the rock. For a moment he gazed about, bewildered by the silence. The
      white card caught his eye. He read its angular scrawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish never to see you again. Never! Never! Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A sulphur-yellow inquisitor, of a more insinuating manner than the former
      participant in their conversation, who had been examining the message on
      his own account, flew to the top of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit? Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his adult life the beetle man threw a stone at a
      bird.

    <h2>
      VIII. &mdash; LOS YANKIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Luncheon on the day following the kiskadee bird's narrow squeak for his
      life was a dreary affair for Mr. Fitzhugh Carroll. Business had called Mr.
      Brewster away. This deprivation the Southerner would have borne with
      equanimity. But Miss Brewster had also absented herself, which was rather
      too much for the devoted, but apprehensive, lover. Thus, ample time was
      given him to consider how ill his suit was prospering. The longer he
      stayed, the less he saw of Miss Polly. That she was kinder and more
      gentle, less given to teasing him than of yore, was poor compensation. He
      was shrewd enough to draw no good augury from that. Something had altered
      her, and he was divided between suspicion of the last week's mail, the
      arrival of which had been about contemporaneous with her change of spirit,
      and some local cause. Was a letter from Smith, the millionaire, or Bobby,
      the friend of her childhood, responsible? Or was the cause nearer at hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      For one preposterous moment he thought of the Unspeakable Perk. A quick
      visualization of that gnomish, froggish face was enough to dispel the
      suspicion. At least the petted and rather fastidious Miss Brewster's fancy
      would be captured only by a gentleman, not by any such homunculus as the
      mountain dweller. Her interest, perhaps; the man possessed the bizarre
      attraction of the freakish. But anything else was absurd. And the knight
      was inclined to attaint his lady for a certain cruelty in the matter; she
      was being something less than fair to the Unspeakable Perk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The searchlight of his surmise ranged farther. Raimonda! The young
      Caracunan was handsome, distinguished, manly, with a romantic charm that
      the American did not underestimate. He, at least, was a gentleman, and the
      assiduity of his attentions to the Northern beauty had become the joke of
      the clubs&mdash;except when Raimonda was present. By the same token, half
      of the gilded youth of the capital, and most of the young diplomats, were
      the sworn slaves of the girl. It was a confused field, indeed. Well, thank
      Heaven, she would soon be out of it! Word had come down from her that she
      was busy packing her things. Carroll wandered about the hotel, waiting for
      the news that would explain this preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came, at mid-afternoon, in the person of Miss Polly herself. Why
      packing trunks, with the aid of an experienced maid, should, even in a hot
      climate, produce heavy circles under the eyes, a droop at the mouth
      corners, and a complete submersion of vivacity, is a problem which Carroil
      then and there gave up. He had too much tact to question or comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm so tired!" she said, giving him her hand. "Have you much packing
      to do, Fitzhugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one has given me any notice to get ready, Miss Polly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very neglectful of me! We may leave at any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you may. But my ship doesn't seem to be coming in very fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      The double entente was unintentional, but the girl winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you coming with us on the yacht?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?" His handsome face lighted hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Dad expects you to. What kind of people should we be to leave
      any friend behind, with matters as they are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes." The hope passed out of his face. "Dictates of humanity, and
      that sort of thing. I think, if you and Mr. Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't be silly, Fitz," she pleaded. "You know it would make me
      most unhappy to leave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely did the scion of Southern blood and breeding lose the self-control
      and reserve on which he prided himself, but he had been harassed by events
      to an unwonted strain of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it making you unhappy to leave any one else here?" he blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge stirred the girl's spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed! I wouldn't care if I never saw any of them again. I'm tired
      of it all. I want to go home," she said, like a pathetic child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Polly," he began, taking a step toward her, "if you'd only let
      me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put up one little sunburned hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Fitz! I&mdash;I don't feel up to it to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbly he subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd no right to ask you the question," he apologized. "It was kind of you
      to answer me at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're really a dear, Fitz," she said, smiling a little wanly. "Sometimes
      I wish&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish her sentence, but wandered over to the window, and
      gazed out across the square. On the far side something quite out of the
      ordinary seemed to be going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The legless beggar seems to have collected quite an audience," she
      remarked idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her suitor joined her on the parlor balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly he's starting a revolution. Any one can do it down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vehement adjuration, in a high, strident voice, came floating across to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!" cried the girl. "He's speaking. English, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to be a mixture of English, French, and Spanish. Quite a
      polyglot the friend of your friend Perkins appears to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned steady eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Perkins is not my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never want to see him, or to hear his name again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then you've found out about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." She flushed. "Yes&mdash;at least&mdash;Yes," she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He admitted it to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he lied about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall go up and make a call on Mr. Perkins," said Carroll, with
      formidable quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it doesn't matter," she answered wearily. "He'd only run away and
      hide." As she said it, her inner self convicted her tongue of lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely. Yet, see here, Miss Polly,&mdash;I want to be fair to that
      fellow. It doesn't follow that because he's a coward he's a cad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't a coward!" she flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just said yourself that he'd run and hide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he wouldn't, and he IS a cad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you like. In any case, I shall make it a point to see him before I
      leave. If he can explain, well and good. If not&mdash;" He did not
      conclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our orator seems to have finished," observed the girl. "I shall go back
      upstairs and write some good-bye notes to the kind people here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just for curiosity, I think I'll drive across and look at the legless
      Demosthenes," said her companion. "I was going to do a little shopping,
      anyway. So I'll report later, if he's revoluting or anything exciting."
    </p>
    <p>
      From her own balcony, when she reached it, Polly had a less obstructed
      view of the beggar's appropriated corner, and she looked out a few minutes
      after she reached the room to see whether he had resumed his oratory.
      Apparently he had not, for the crowd had melted away. The legless one was
      rocking himself monotonously upon his stumps. His head was sunk forward,
      and from his extraordinary mouthings the spectator judged that he must be
      talking to himself with resumed vehemence. From what next passed before
      her astonished vision, Miss Brewster would have suspected herself of a
      hallucination of delirium had she not been sure of normal health.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the well-horsed, elegant little public victorias with which the
      city is so well supplied stopped at the curb, and the handsome head of
      Preston Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll was thrust forth. At almost the same
      moment the Unspeakable Perk appeared upon the steps. He was wearing a pair
      of enormous, misfit white gloves. He went down to the beggar, reached
      forth a hand, and, to the far-away spectator's wonder-struck
      interpretation, seemed to thrust something, presumably a document, into
      the breast of the mendicant's shirt. Having performed this strange rite,
      he leaped up the steps, hesitated, rushed over to Carroll's equipage, and
      laid violent hands upon the occupant, with obvious intent to draw him
      forth. For a moment they seemed to struggle upon the sidewalk; then both
      rushed upon the unfortunate beggar and proceeded to kidnap him and thrust
      him bodily into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver turned in his seat at this point, his cue in the mad farce
      having been given, and opened speech with many gestures, whereupon Carroll
      arose and embraced him warmly. And with this grouping, the vehicle,
      bearing its lunatic load, sped around the corner and disappeared, while
      the sole interested witness retired to obscurity, with her reeling head
      between her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      One final touch of phantasy was given to the whole affair when, two hours
      later, she met Carroll, soiled and grimy, coming across the plaza, smoking&mdash;he,
      the addict to thirty-cent Havanas!&mdash;an awful native cheroot, whose
      incense spread desolation about him. Further and more extraordinary, when
      she essayed to obtain a solution of the mystery from him, he repelled her
      with emphatic gestures and a few half-strangled words with whose
      unintelligibility the cheroot fumes may have had some connection, and
      hurried into the hotel, where he remained in seclusion the rest of the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      What in the name of all the wonders could it mean? On Mr. Brewster's
      return, she laid the matter before him at the dinner table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Touch of the sun, perhaps," he hazarded. "Nothing else I know of would
      explain it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do two Americans, a half-breed beggar, and a local coachman get sunstruck
      at one and the same time?" she inquired disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't seem likely. By your account, though, the crippled beggar seems
      to have been the little Charlie Ross of melodrama."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why didn't he shout for help? I listened, but didn't hear a sound
      from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Movie-picture rehearsal," grunted Mr. Brewster. "I can't quite see the
      heir of all the Virginias in the part. Isn't he coming down to dinner this
      evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His dinner was sent up to his room. Isn't it extraordinary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask Sherwen about it. He's coming around this evening for coffee in our
      rooms."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the American representative had something else on his mind besides
      casual kidnapings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just come from a talk with the British Minister," he remarked,
      setting down his cup. "He's officially in charge of American interests,
      you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought you were," said Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Officially, I have no existence. The United States of America is wiped
      off the map, so far as the sovereign Republic of Caracuna is concerned.
      Some of its politicians wouldn't be over-grieved if the local Americans
      underwent the same process. The British Minister would, I'm sure, sleep
      easier if you were all a thousand miles away from here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Sir Willet that he's very ungallant," pouted Miss Polly. "When I sat
      next to him at dinner last week he offered to establish woman suffrage
      here and elect me next president if I'd stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherwen hardly paid this the tribute of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was before he found out certain things. The Hochwald Legation"&mdash;he
      lowered his voice&mdash;"is undoubtedly stirring up anti-American
      sentiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?" inquired Mr. Brewster. "There's enough trade for them and for
      us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one thing, they don't like your concessions, Mr. Brewster. Then they
      have heard that Dr. Pruyn is on his way, and they want to make all the
      trouble they can for him, and make it impossible for him to get actual
      information of the presence of plague. I happen to know that their consul
      is officially declaring fake all the plague rumors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That suits me," declared the magnate. "We don't want to have to run Dutch
      and quarantine blockade both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meantime, there are two or three cheap but dangerous demagogues who have
      been making anti-'Yanki,' as they call us, speeches in the slums. Sir
      Willet doesn't like the looks of it. If there were any way in which you
      could get through, and to sea, it would be well to take it at once. Am I
      correct in supposing that you've taken steps to clear the yacht, Mr.
      Brewster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. That is, I've sent a message. Or, at least, so my daughter, to whose
      management I left it, believes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell me how," said Sherwen quickly. "There is reason to believe
      that it has been dispatched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've heard something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a message from our consul at Puerto del Norte, Mr. Wisner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me?" asked the concessionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," was the hesitant reply. "It isn't quite clear, but it seems to
      be for Miss Brewster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" inquired that young lady coolly. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best I could make of it over the phone&mdash;Wisner had to be guarded&mdash;was
      that people planning to take Dutch leave would better pay their parting
      calls by to-morrow at the latest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would mean day after to-morrow, wouldn't it?" mused the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it means anything at all," substituted her father testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meantime, how do you like the Gran Hotel Kast, Miss Brewster?" asked
      Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's awful beyond words! I've done nothing but wish for a brigade of
      Biddies, with good stout mops, and a government permit to clean up. I'd
      give it a bath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's pretty bad. I'm glad you don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad? Is every one ag'in' poor me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;well, the American Legation is a very lonely place. Now,
      the presence of an American lady&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you offering a proposal of marriage, Mr. Sherwen?" twinkled the girl.
      "If so&mdash;Dad, please leave the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knock twenty years off my battle-scarred life and you wouldn't be safe a
      minute," he retorted. "But, no. This is a measure of safety. Sir Willet
      thinks that your party ought to be ready to move into the American
      Legation on instant notice, if you can't get away to sea to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use, if the legation has no official existence?" asked Mr.
      Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense it has. It would probably be respected by a mob. And, at the
      worst, it adjoins the British Legation, which would be quite safe. If it
      weren't that Sir Willet's boy has typhoid, you'd be formally invited to go
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very good of you," said Miss Polly warmly. "But surely it would be
      an awful nuisance to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, you'd brace up my far-too-casual old housekeeper and get
      the machinery running. She constantly takes advantage of my bachelor
      ignorance. If you say you'll come, I'll almost pray for the outbreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly we'll come, at any time you notify us," said Mr. Brewster. "And
      we're very grateful. Shall you have room for Mr. Carroll, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means. And I've notified Mr. Cluff. You won't mind his being
      there? He's a rough diamond, but a thoroughly decent fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Useful, too, in case of trouble, I should judge," said the magnate. "Then
      I'll wait for further word from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I've got my men out on watch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't it be&mdash;er&mdash;advisable for us to arm ourselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means! There's just one course to follow; keep the peace at any
      price, and give the Hochwaldians not the slightest peg on which to hang a
      charge that Americans have been responsible for any trouble that might
      arise. May I ask you," he added significantly, "to make this clear to Mr.
      Carroll?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave that to me," said Miss Brewster, with superb confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Content, indeed! You'll find our locality very pleasant, Miss Brewster.
      Three of the other legations are on the same block, not including the
      Hochwaldian, which is a quarter of a mile down the hill. On our corner is
      a house where several of the English railroad men live, and across is the
      Club Amicitia, made up largely of the jeunesse doree, who are mostly
      pro-American. So you'll be quite surrounded by friends, not to say
      adherents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call on me to housekeep for you at any time," cried Polly gayly. "I'll

    <h2>
      IX. &mdash; THE BLACK WARNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      That weird three-part drama in the plaza which had so puzzled Miss Polly
      Brewster had developed in this wise:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincidently with the departure of Preston Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll from
      the hotel in his cab, the Unspeakable Perk emerged from a store near the
      far corner of the square, which exploited itself in the purest Castilian
      as offering the last word in the matter of gentlemen's apparel. "Articulos
      para Caballeros" was the representation held forth upon its signboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had articled Mr. Perkins, it must be confessed that it had done its
      job unevenly, not to say fantastically. His linen was fresh and new, quite
      conspicuously so, and, therefore, in sharp contrast to the frayed and
      patched, but scrupulously clean and neatly pressed khaki suit, which set
      forth rather bumpily his solid figure. A serviceable pith helmet barely
      overhung the protrusive goggles. His hands were encased in white cotton
      gloves, a size or two too large. Dismal buff spots on the palms impaired
      their otherwise virgin purity. As the wearer carried his hands stiffly
      splayed, the blemishes were obtrusive. Altogether, one might have said
      that, if he were going in for farce, he was appropriately made up for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner above the beggar's niche he was turning toward a
      pharmacist's entrance, when the mirth of the departing crowd that had been
      enjoying the free oratory attracted his attention. He glanced across at
      the beggar, now rocking rhythmically on his stumps, hesitated a moment,
      then ran down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment Carroll's cab stopped on the other angle of the curb.
      The occupant put forth his head, saw the goggled freak descending to the
      legless freak, and sat back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hola, Pancho! Are you ill?" asked the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beggar only swung back and forth, muttering with frenzied rapidity.
      With one hand the Unspeakable Perk stopped him, as one might intercept the
      runaway pendulum of a clock, setting the other on his forehead. Then he
      bent and brought his goblin eyes to bear on the dark face. The features
      were distorted, the eyelids tremulous over suffused eyes, and the teeth
      set. Opening the man's loose shirt, Perkins thrust his hand within. It
      might have been supposed that he was feeling for the heart action, were it
      not that his hand slid past the breast and around under the arm. When he
      drew it out, he stood for a moment with chin dropped, in consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midday heat had all but cleared the plaza. As he looked about, the helper
      saw no aid, until his eye fell upon the waiting cab. He fairly bounded up
      the stairs, calling something to the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," grunted that toiler, with the characteristic discourtesy of the
      Caracunan lower class, and jerked his head backward toward his fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," said the Unspeakable Perk eagerly, in Spanish,
      turning to the dim recess of the victoria. "Might I&mdash;Oh, it's you!"
      He seized Carroll by the arm. "I want your cab."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Carroll. "Well, you're cool enough about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your help," added the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you have to ask questions? The man may be dying&mdash;is dying, I
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Carroll promptly. "What's to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get him home. Help me carry him to the cab."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them, the two men lifted the heavy, mumbling cripple, carried him
      up the steps with a rush, and deposited him in the cab, while the driver
      was still angrily expostulating. The beggar was shivering now, and the
      cold sweat rolled down his face. His bearers placed themselves on each
      side of him. Perkins gave an order to the driver, who seemed to object,
      and a rapid-fire argument ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says he won't go there. Says he was hired by you for shopping."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll took one look at the agony-wrung face of the beggar, who was being
      held on the seat by his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't he?" said he grimly. "We'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, he threw a pair of long arms around those of the driver, pinning
      him, caught the reins, and turned the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now ask him if he'll drive," he directed Perkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, senor!" gasped the coachman, whose breath had been squeezed almost
      through his crackling ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that you do," the Southerner bade him, in accents that needed no
      interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Perkins looked up from his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a cigar?" he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the other, a little disgusted by this levity in the presence
      of imminent death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins bade the driver stop at the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let him fall off the seat," he admonished Carroll, and jumped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a minute he reappeared, smoking a cheroot that appeared
      to be writhing and twisting in the effort to escape from its own noxious
      fumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have one," he said, extending a handful to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care for it," returned the other superciliously. While willing to
      aid in a good work, he did not in the least approve either of the
      Unspeakable Perk or of his offhand manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had gone much farther, his resentment was heated to the point
      of offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it necessary for you to puff every puff of that infernal smoke in my
      face?" he demanded ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you wouldn't smoke, yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it weren't for this poor devil of a sick man&mdash;" began Carroll,
      when a second thought about the smoke diverted his line of thought. "Is it
      contagious?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so regarded," observed the other dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take one of those, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins handed him one of the rejected spirals. In silence, except for the
      outrageous rattling of the wheels on the cobbles, they drove through mean
      streets that grew ever meaner, until they drew up at the blind front of a
      building abutting on an arroyo of the foothills. Here they stopped, and
      Carroll threw his jehu a five-bolivar piece, which the driver caught,
      driving away at once, without the demand for more which usually follows
      overpayment in Caracuna. Convenient to hand lay a small rock. Perkins used
      it for a knocker, hammering on the guarded wooden door with such vehemence
      as to still the clamor that arose from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the opening, as the barrier was removed by a leather-skinned old
      crone, Carroll gazed into a passageway, beyond which stretched a foul mule
      yard, bordered by what the visitor at first supposed to be stalls, until
      he saw bedding and utensils in them. The two men lifted the cripple in,
      amid the outcries and lamentations of the aged woman, who had looked at
      his face and then covered her own. At once they were surrounded by a swarm
      of women and children, who pressed upon them, hampering their movements,
      until a shrill voice cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "La muerte negra!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The swarm fell into silence, scattered, vanished, leaving only the moaning
      woman to help. At her direction they settled the patient on a straw pallet
      in a side room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all you can do," said the Unspeakable Perk to his companion. "And
      thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      The goggles gloomed upon him in the dim room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought probably you would," commented Perkins, and busied himself over
      the cripple with a knife and some cloths. He had stuffed his ludicrous
      white gloves into his pocket, and was tearing strips from his handkerchief
      with skillful fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oughtn't he to have a doctor?" asked Carroll. "Shall I go for one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His mother has sent. No use, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't be saved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a chance on earth. I should say he was in the last stages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" said Carroll hesitantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La muerte negra. The black death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plague?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure? Are you an expert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't have to be to recognize a case like that. The lump in the
      armpit is as big as a pigeon's egg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you interested yourself in the man to such an extent?" asked
      Carroll curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a friend of mine. Why did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's quite different. One can't disregard a call for help such as
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain kind of 'one' can't," returned the Unspeakable Perk, with his
      half-smile. "You don't mind my saying, Mr. Carroll, you're a brave man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'd have said that you weren't," replied the other bluntly. "I give
      it up. But I know this: I'm going to be pretty wretchedly frightened until
      I know that I haven't got it. I'm frightened now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you're a braver man than I thought. But the danger may be less than
      you think. Stick to that cigar&mdash;here are two more&mdash;and wait for
      me outside. Here's the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Profound and solemn under a silk hat, the local physician entered, bowing
      to Carroll as they passed in the hallway. Almost immediately Perkins
      emerged. On his face was a sardonic grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malaria," he observed. "The learned professor assures me that it's a
      typical malaria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it isn't the plague," said Carroll, relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relief was of brief duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it's plague. But if Professor Silk Hat, in there, officially
      declared it such, he'd have bracelets on his arms in twelve hours. The
      present Government of Caracuia doesn't believe in bubonic plague. I fancy
      our unfortunate friend in there will presently disappear, either just
      before or just after death. It doesn't greatly matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done now?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See that brush fire up there?" The hermit pointed to the hillside. "If we
      steep ourselves in that smoke until we choke, I think it will discourage
      any fleas that may have harbored on us. The flea is the only agent of
      communication."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soot-begrimed, strangling, and with streaming eyes, they emerged, five
      minutes later, from the cloud of smoke. From his pocket the Unspeakable
      Perk dragged forth his white gloves. The action attracted his companion's
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord!" he cried. "What has happened to your hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're blistered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stripped, rather. They look as if you'd fallen into a fire, or rowed a
      fifty-mile race. That message of Mr. Brewster's&mdash;See here, Perkins,
      you didn't row that over to the mainland? No, you couldn't. That's absurd.
      It's too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I didn't row it to the mainland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you've been rowing. I'd swear to those hands. Where? The blockading
      Dutch warship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night. Yah-h-h!" he yawned. "It makes me sleepy to think of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't they blow you out of the water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I was semiofficially expected. Message from our consul. They
      transferred the message by wireless. I'm telling you all this, Mr.
      Carroll, because I think you'll get your release within forty-eight hours,
      and I want you to see that some of your party keeps constantly in touch
      with Mr. Sherwen. It's mighty important that your party should get out
      before plague is officially declared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to report this case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that I know about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, of course, you can't report officially, not being a physician,"
      mused the other. "Still, when Dr. Pruyn comes, it will be evidence for
      him, won't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly. I should consider any delay after twenty-four hours risky
      for your party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall you do? Stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've my place in the mountains. That's remote enough to be safe.
      Thank Heaven, there's a cloud over the sun! Let's sit down by this tree
      for a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unthinkingly, as he stretched himself out, the Unspeakable Perk pushed his
      goggles back and presently slipped them off. Thus, when Carroll, who had
      been gazing at the mist-capped peak of the mountain in front, turned and
      met his companion's eyes, he underwent something of the same shock that
      Polly Brewster had experienced, though the nature of his sensation was
      profoundly different. But his impression of the suddenly revealed face was
      the same. Ribbed-in though his mind was with tradition, and distorted with
      falsely focused ideals and prejudices, Preston Fairfax Fitzhugh Carroll
      possessed a sound underlying judgment of his fellow man, and was at bottom
      a frank and honorable gentleman. In his belief, the suddenly revealed face
      of the man beside him came near to being its own guaranty of honor and
      good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heavens, I don't believe it!" he blurted out, his gaze direct upon the
      Unspeakable Perk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What don't you believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That rotten club gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Carroll, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit pushed his glasses down, settled into place the white gloves,
      with their soothing contents of emollient greases, and got to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd best be moving. I've got much to do," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet," retorted Carroll. "Perkins, is there a woman up there on the
      mountains with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is purely my own business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told Miss Brewster there wasn't. If you tell me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never told her any such thing. She misunderstood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want it even more frankly, that is none of your concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been letting Miss Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you engaged to marry Miss Brewster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have no authority to question me. But," he added wearily, "if it
      will ease your mind, and because of what you've done to-day, I 'll tell
      you this&mdash;that I do not expect ever to see Miss Brewster again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't enough," insisted Carroll, his face darkening. "Her name has
      already been connected with yours, and I intend to follow this through. I
      am going to find out who the woman is at your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you propose to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By coming to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be welcome," said the other grimly. "By the way, here's a map." He
      made a quick sketch on the back of an envelope. "I'll be there at work
      most of to-morrow. Au revoir." He rose and started down the hill. "Better
      keep to yourself this evening," he warned. "Take a dilute carbolic bath.
      You'll be all right, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and thoughtfully the Southerner made his way back to the hotel.
      After dining in his own room, he found time heavy on his hands; so,
      dispatching a note of excuse to Miss Brewster on the plea of personal
      business, he slipped out into the city. Wandering idly toward the hills,
      he presently found himself in a familiar street, and, impelled by human
      curiosity, proceeded to turn up the hill and stop opposite the blank door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was puzzled. To go in and inquire, even if he cared to and could
      make himself understood, would perhaps involve further risk of infection.
      While he was considering, the door slowly opened, and the leather-skinned
      crone appeared. Her eyes were swollen. In her hand she carried a travesty
      of a wreath, done in whitish metal, which she had interwoven with her own
      black mantilla, the best substitute for crape at hand. This she undertook
      to hang on the door. As Carroll crossed to address her, a powerful,
      sullen-faced man, with a scarred forehead and the insignia of some
      official status, apparently civic, on his coat, emerged from a doorway and
      addressed her harshly. She raised her reddened eyes to him and seemed to
      be pleading for permission to set up the little tribute to her dead. There
      was the exchange of a few more words. Then, with an angry exclamation, the
      official snatched the wreath from her. Carroll's hand fell on his
      shoulder. The man swung and saw a stranger of barely half his bulk, who
      addressed him in what seemed to be politely remonstrant tones. He shook
      himself loose and threw the wreath in the crone's face. Then he went down
      like a log under the impact of a swinging blow behind the ear. With a roar
      he leaped up and rushed. The foreigner met him with right and left, and
      this time he lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanging the tragically unsightly wreath on the door, through which the
      terrified mourner had vanished, Carroll returned to the Gran Hotel Kast,
      his perturbed and confused thoughts and emotions notably relieved by that
      one comforting moment of action.

    <h2>
      X. &mdash; THE FOLLY OF PERK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the comprehensive superiority of the American Legation over the Gran
      Hotel Kast there could be no shadow of a doubt. From the moment of their
      arrival at noon of the day after the British Minister's warning, the
      refugees found themselves comfortable and content, Miss Brewster having
      quietly and tactfully taken over the management of internal affairs and
      reigning, at Sherwen's request, as generalissima. No disturbance had
      marked the transfer to their new abode. In fact, so wholly lacking was any
      evidence of hostility to the foreigners on the part of the crowds on the
      streets that the Brewsters rather felt themselves to be extorting
      hospitality on false pretenses. Sherwen, however, exhibited signal relief
      upon seeing them safely housed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please stay that way, too," he requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it seems so unnecessary, and I want to market," protested Miss Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means! The market is the last place where any of us should be seen.
      It is in that section that Urgante has been doing his work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wandering demagogue and cheap politician. Abuse of the 'Yankis' is his
      stock in trade. Somebody has been furnishing him money lately. That's the
      sole fuel to his fires of oratory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bet the bills smelled of sauerkraut when they reached him," grunted
      Cluff, striding over to the window of the drawing-room, where the informal
      conference was being held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They may have had a Hochwaldian origin," admitted Sherwen. "But it would
      be difficult to prove."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least the Hochwald Legation wouldn't shed any tears over a
      demonstration against us," said Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well within the limits of diplomatic truth," smiled the American
      official.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" Mr. Brewster puffed the whole matter out of consideration. "I
      don't believe a word of it. Some of my acquaintances at the club, men in
      high governmental positions, assure me that there is no anti-American
      feeling here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely they do. Frankness and plain-speaking being, as you doubtless
      know, the distinguishing mark of the Caracunan statesman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sarcasm was not lost upon Mr. Brewster, but it failed to shake his
      skepticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some business matters that require that I should go to the
      office of the Ferro carril del Norte this afternoon," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg that you do nothing of the sort," cried Sherwen sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnate hesitated. He glanced out of the window and along the street,
      close bounded by blank-walled houses, each with its eyes closed against
      the sun. A solitary figure strode rapidly across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's that bug-hunting fellow again," said Mr. Brewster. "He's an
      American, I guess,&mdash;God save the mark! Nobody seems to be interfering
      with HIM, and he's freaky enough looking to start a riot on Broadway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Further comment was checked by the voice of the scientist at the door,
      asking to see Mr. Sherwen at once. Miss Polly immediately slipped out of
      the room to the patio, followed by Carroll and Cluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My business, probably," remarked Mr. Brewster. "I'll just stay and see."
      And he stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as the newcomer was concerned, however, he might as well not have
      been there; so he felt, with unwonted injury. The scientist, disregarding
      him wholly, shook hands with Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard from Wisner yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. An hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was his message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, any time to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Better get them down to-night, then, so they can start to-morrow
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Stark pass them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under restrictions. That's all been seen to."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point it appeared to Mr. Brewster that he had figured as a cipher
      quite long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I right in assuming that you are talking of my party's departure?" he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Sherwen. "The Dutch will let you through the blockade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then my cablegram reached the proper parties at Washington," said the
      magnate, with an I-knew-it-would-be-that-way air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to Mr. Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course. That will be&mdash;er&mdash;suitably attended to
      later."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unspeakable Perk turned and regarded him fixedly; but, owing to the
      goggles, the expression was indeterminable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is it would be more convenient for me to go day after to-morrow
      than to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you'd better rent a house," was the begoggled one's sharp and brief
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?" queried the great man, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because if you don't get out to-morrow, you may not get out for months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I understand the Dutch permit, it specifies AFTER to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a question of the Dutch. Caracuna City goes under quarantine
      to-night, and Puerto del Norte to-morrow, as soon as proper official
      notification can be given."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then plague has actually been found?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Determined by bacteriological test this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was present at the finding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did it? Dr. Pruyn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherwen whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better make ready to move, Mr. Brewster," he advised. "You can't get out
      of port after quarantine is on. At least, you couldn't get into any other
      port, even if you sailed, because your sailing-master wouldn't have
      clearance papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnate smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly think that any United States Consul, with a due regard for his
      future, would refuse papers to the yacht Polly," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a fool!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher Brewster all but jumped from his chair. That this adjuration
      should have come from the freakish spectacle-wearer seemed impossible. Yet
      Sherwen, the only other person in the room, was certainly not guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you address me, young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, sir, that since boyhood no person has dared or would dare to
      call me a fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't want to set a fashion," said the other equably. "I'm only
      advising you not to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your advice until it's wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were a question of you alone, I would. But there are others to be
      considered. Now, listen, Mr. Brewster: Wisner and Stark wouldn't let you
      through that quarantine, after it's declared, if you were the Secretary
      himself. A point is being stretched in giving you this chance. If you'll
      agree to ship a doctor,&mdash;Stark will find you one,&mdash;stay out for
      six full days before touching anywhere, and, if plague develops, make at
      once for any detention station specified by the doctor, you can go. Those
      are Stark's conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damnable nonsense!" declared Mr. Brewster, jumping to his feet, quite red
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me warn you, Mr. Brewster," put in Sherwen, with quiet force, "that
      you are taking a most unwise course. I am advised that Mr. Perkins is
      acting under instructions from our consulate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that Dr. Pruyn is here. I want to see him before&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you see him? Nobody knows where he is keeping himself. I haven't
      seen him yet myself. Now, Mr. Brewster, just sit down and talk this over
      reasonably with Mr. Perkins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said the third conferee positively; "I've no time for argument.
      At six o'clock I 'll be back here. Unless you decide by then, I'll
      telephone the consulate that the whole thing is off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all the impudent, conceited, self-important young whippersnappers!"
      fumed Mr. Brewster. But he found that he had no audience, as Sherwen had
      followed the scientist out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the afternoon was over, the American concessionnaire had come to
      realize that the situation was less assured than he had thought. Twice the
      British Minister had come, and there had been calls from the
      representatives of several other nationalities. Von Plaanden, in full
      uniform and girt with the short saber that is the special and privileged
      arm of the crack cavalry regiment to which he belonged at home, had
      dismounted to deliver personally a huge bouquet for Miss Brewster, from
      the garden of the Hochwald Legation, not even asking to see the girl, but
      merely leaving the flowers as a further expression of his almost daily
      apology, and riding on to an official review at the military park.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken vaguely to Sherwen of a restless condition of the local
      mind. Reports, it appeared, had been set afloat among the populace to the
      effect that an American sanitary officer had been bribed by the enemies of
      Caracuna to declare plague prevalent, in order to close the ports and
      strangle commerce. Urgante was going about the lower part of the city
      haranguing on street corners without interference from the police. In the
      arroyo of the slaughter-house, two American employees of the street-car
      company had been stoned and beaten. Much aguardiente was in process of
      consumption, it being a half-holiday in honor of some saint, and nobody
      knew what trouble might break out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bolas are rolling around like balls on a billiard table," said young
      Raimonda, who had come after luncheon to call on Miss Brewster. "In this
      part of the city there will be nothing. You needn't be alarmed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not afraid," said Miss Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure of it," declared the Caracunan, with admiration. "You are very
      wonderful, you American women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. It's only that we love excitement," she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that is all very well, for a bull-fight or 'la boxe.' But for one of
      our street emeutes&mdash;no; too much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated on the roof of the half-story of the house, which had
      been made into a trellised porch overlooking the patio in the rear and the
      street in front, an architectural wonder in that city of dead walls flush
      with the sidewalk line all the way up. Leaning over the rail, the visitor
      pointed through the leaves of a small gallito tree to a broad-fronted
      building almost opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my club. You have other friends there who would do anything for
      you, as I would, so gladly," he added wistfully. "Will you honor me by
      accepting this little whistle? It is my hunting-whistle. And if there
      should be anything&mdash;but I think there will not&mdash;you will blow
      it, and there will be plenty to answer. If not, you will keep it, please,
      to remember one who will not forget you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Handsome and elegant and courtly he was, a true chevalier of adventurous
      pioneering stock, sprung from the old proud Spanish blood, but there stole
      behind the girl's vision, as she bade him farewell, the undesired phantasm
      of a very different face, weary and lined and lighted by steadfast gray
      eyes&mdash;eyes that looked truthful and belonged to a liar! Miss Polly
      Brewster resumed her final packing in a fume of rage at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands among the visitors passed the afternoon dully. Mr. Brewster, who
      had finally yielded to persuasion and decided not to venture out, though
      still deriding the restriction as the merest nonsense, was in a mood of
      restless silence, which his irrepressible daughter described to Fitzhugh
      Carroll as "the superior sulks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll himself kept pretty much aloof. He had the air of a man who
      wrestles with a problem. Cluff fussed and fretted and privately cursed the
      country and all its concessions. Between calls and the telephone, Sherwen
      was kept constantly busy. But a few minutes before six, central, in the
      blandest Spanish, regretted to inform him that Puerto del Norte was cut
      off. When would service be resumed? Quien sabe? It was an order. Hasta
      manana. To-morrow, perhaps. Smoothing a furrow from his brow, the sight of
      which would have done nobody any good, he suggested that they all gather
      on the roof porch for a swizzle. The suggestion was hailed with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when the Unspeakable Perk came hustling down the street some minutes
      earlier than the appointed time, he was hailed in Sherwen's voice, and
      bidden to come directly up. No time, on this occasion, for Miss Polly to
      escape. She decided in one breath to ignore the man entirely; in the next
      to bow coldly and walk out; in the next to&mdash;He was there before the
      latest wavering decision could be formulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better all get inside," he said a little breathlessly. "There may be
      trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cluff brightened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Urgante is leading a mob up this way. They're turning the corner now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to wait and see them," cried Miss Polly, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bend over, then, all of you," ordered Sherwen. "The vines will cover you
      if you keep down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the corner, up the hill from where they were, streamed a rabble of
      boys, leaping and whooping, and after them a more compact crowd of men,
      shoeless, centering on a tall, broad, heavy-mustached fellow who bore on a
      short staff the Stars and Stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where on earth did he get that?" cried Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looted the Bazaar Americana," replied Perkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Urgante," growled Cluff; "that devil with the flag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he seems to be eulogizing it," cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator had set down his bright burden, wedging it in the iron guard
      railing of a tree, and was now apostrophizing it with extravagant bows and
      honeyed accents in which there was an undertone of hiss. For confirmation,
      Miss Polly turned to the others. The first face her eyes fell on was that
      of the ball-player. Every muscle in it was drawn, and from the tightened
      lips streamed such whispered curses as the girl never before had heard.
      Next him stood the hermit, solid and still, but with a queer spreading
      pallor under his tan. In front of them Sherwen was crouched, scowlingly
      alert. The expression of Mr. Brewster and Carroll, neither of whom
      understood Spanish, betokened watchful puzzlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enlightenment burst upon them the next minute. From the motley crowd below
      rose a snarl of laughter and savage jeering, the object of which was
      unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By G&mdash;d!" cried Mr. Brewster, straightening up and grasping the
      railing. "They're insulting the flag!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've left my pistol!" muttered Carroll, white-lipped. "I've left my
      pistol!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Brewster's hand flew to her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew out the automatic and held it toward the Southerner. But it was
      not Carroll's hand that met hers; it was the Unspeakable Perk's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he, and he flung the weapon back of him into the patio.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Oh!" cried the girl. "You unspeakable coward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll jumped forward, but Sherwen was equally quick. He interposed his
      slight frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins is right," he said decisively. "No shooting. It would be worth
      the life of every one here. We've got to stand it. But somebody is going
      to sweat blood for this day's work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinct of discipline, characteristic of the professional athlete,
      brought Cluff to his support.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Mr. Sherwen says, goes," he said, almost choking on the words.
      "We've got to stand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the breast of Miss Polly Brewster was no response to this spirit. She
      was lawless with the lawlessness of unconquered youth and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she breathed "If I had my pistol back, I'd shoot that BEAST myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientist turned his goggles hesitantly upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Brewster," he began, "please don't think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak to me!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another clamor of derision sounded from the street as Urgante resumed the
      standard of his mockery and led his rabble forward. Behind the
      dull-colored mass appeared a spot of splendor. It was Von Plaanden,
      gorgeous in his full regalia, who had turned the corner, returning from
      the public reception. Well back of the mob, he pulled his horse up, and
      sat watching. The coincidence was unfortunate. It seemed to justify
      Sherwen's bitter words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to visa his work. There's the Hochwaldian for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Forward danced and reeled the "Yanki" baiters below, until they were under
      the balcony where the little group of Americans sheltered and raged
      silently. There the orator again spewed forth his contempt upon the alien
      banner, and again the ranks behind him shrieked their approval of the
      affront. Miss Polly Brewster, American of Americans, whose
      great-grandfathers had fought with Herkimer and Steuben,&mdash;themselves
      the sons of women who had stood by the loopholes of log houses and caught
      up the rifles of their fallen pioneer husbands, wherewith to return the
      fire of the besieging Mohawks,&mdash;ran forward to the railing, snatching
      her skirt from the detaining grasp of her father. In the corner stood a
      huge bowl of roses. Gathering both hands full, she leaned forward and
      flung them, so that they fell in a shower of loveliness upon the insulted
      flag of her nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant silence fell upon the "great unwashed" below. Out of it
      swelled a muttering as the leader made a low, mocking obeisance to the
      girl, following it with a word that brought a jubilant yelp from his
      adherents. Stooping, he ladled up in his cupped hand a quantity of gutter
      filth. Where the flowers had but a moment before fluttered in the folds,
      he splotched it, smearing star, bar, and blue with its blackness. At the
      sight, the girl burst into helpless tears, and so stood weeping, openly,
      bitterly, and unashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No brain is so well ordered, no emotion so thoroughly controlled, but that
      under sudden pressure&mdash;click!&mdash;the mechanism slips a cog and
      runs amuck. Just that thing happened inside the Unspeakable Perk's
      smooth-running, scientific brain upon incitement of his flag's desecration
      and his lady's grief. To her it seemed that he shot past her horizontally
      like a human dart. The next second he was over the railing, had swung from
      a branch of the neighboring tree to the trunk, and leaped to the ground,
      all in one movement of superhuman agility. To the mob his exploit was
      apparently without immediate significance. Perhaps they didn't notice the
      descent; or perhaps those few who saw were so astonished at the apparition
      of a chunky tree-man with protuberant eyes scrambling down upon them in
      the manner of an ape, that they failed to appreciate what it might portend
      of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit landed solidly on his feet a few yards from Urgante, the flag
      bearer. With a berserker yell, he rushed. Taken by surprise, the assailed
      one still had time to lift the heavy staff. As quickly, the American
      lowered his head and dove. It may not have been magnificent; it certainly
      was not war by the rules; but it was eminently effective. To say that the
      leader went down would be absurdly inadequate. He simply crumpled. Over
      and over he rolled on the cobbles, while the smirched flag flew clear of
      his grasp, and fell on the farther sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wow!" yelled Cluff, leaping into the air. "Football! That cost him a
      couple of ribs. Hey, Rube!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he rushed for the stairs, followed by Carroll, Sherwen, and, only one
      jump behind, Mr. Thatcher Brewster, cursing in a manner that did credit to
      his patriotism, but would have added no luster to his record as an elder
      of the Pioneer Presbyterian Church, of Utica, New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the Unspeakable Perk, having rolled free of the fallen enemy,
      staggered to his feet and caught up the flag. Stunned surprise on the part
      of the crowd gave him an instant's time. He edged along the curb, hoping
      to gain the legation door by a rush. But the foe threw out a wing, cutting
      him off. Several eager followers had lifted Urgante, whose groans and
      curses suggested a sound basis for Cluff's diagnosis. Himself quite hors
      de combat, he spat at the Unspeakable Perk, and cried upon his henchmen to
      kill the "Yanki." It seemed not improbable to the latter that they would
      do it. Perkins set his back to the wall, twirled the flag folds tight
      around the pole, reversed and clubbed the staff, and prepared to make any
      attempt at killing as uncomfortable and unprofitable as possible. The
      rabble, by no means favorably impressed by these businesslike proceedings,
      stood back, growling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand flew up above the crowd. The Unspeakable Perk ducked sharply and
      just in time, as a knife struck the wall above him and clattered to the
      pavement. Instantly he caught it up, but the blade had snapped off short.
      As he stooped, one bold spirit rushed in. Perkins met him with a straight
      lance-thrust of the staff, which sent him reeling and shrieking with pain
      back to his fellows. But now another knife, and another, struck and fell
      from the wall at his back; badly aimed both, but presumably the
      forerunners of missiles, some of which would show better marksmanship. The
      assailed man cast a swift, desperate look about him; the crowd closed in a
      little. Obviously he must keep "eyes front."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your left! To your left!" The voice came to him clear and sweet above
      the swelling growl of the rabble. "The doorway! Get into the doorway, Mr.
      Beetle Man."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few paces away, how far Perkins could only guess, was the entrance to
      the house. He surmised that, like many of the better-class houses, it had
      a small set-in door, at right angles to the main entrance, that would
      serve as a shallow shelter. Without raising his eyes, he nodded
      comprehension, and began to edge along the wall, swinging his stout
      weapon. As he went, he wondered what was keeping the others. At that
      moment the others were frantically wrestling with the all-too-adequate
      bars with which Sherwen had reinforced the wide door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perkins, feeling with a cautious heel, found himself opposite the entry
      indicated by the voice. Turning, he darted into the narrow embrasure. Here
      he was comparatively safe from the missiles that were now coming from all
      directions. On the other hand, he now lacked room to swing his formidable
      club. The peons, with a shout, closed in to arm's length. Alone on her
      balcony, the girl turned her head away and cried aloud, hopelessly, for
      help. She wanted to close her ears against the bestial shouts of a mob
      trampling to death a defenseless man, but her arms were of lead. She
      listened and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the sound that she dreaded there came the ringing of hoofs on
      stones, followed by yells of alarm. She opened her eyes to see Von
      Plaanden, bent forward in his saddle at the exact angle proper to the
      charge, urging his great horse down upon the mass of people as ruthlessly
      as if they had been so many insects. Through the circle he broke, swinging
      his mount around beside the shallow doorway before which three Caracunans
      already lay sprawled, attesting the vigor of the defender's final
      resistance. Back of the horseman lay half a dozen other figures. The
      Hochwaldian jerked out his sword and stood, a splendid spectacle. Very
      possibly he was not wholly unmindful of his own pictorial quality or of
      the lovely American witness thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      His intervention gave a few seconds' respite, one of those checks that
      save battles and make history. Now, in the further making of this
      particular history, sounded a lusty whoop from the opposite direction;
      such a battle slogan as only the Anglo-Saxon gives. It emanated from Galpy
      the bounder, bounding now, indeed, at full speed up the slope, followed by
      two of his fellow railroad men, flannel-clad and still perspiring from
      their afternoon's cricket. Against bare legs a cricket bat is a highly
      dissuasive argument. The Britons swung low and hard for the ancient right
      of the breed to break into a row wherever white men are in the minority
      against other races. The downhill wing of the mob being much the weakest,
      opened up for them with little resistance, leaving them a free path to the
      cavalryman, to whose side Perkins, with staff ready brandished, had
      advanced from his shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wot's the merry game?" inquired the cockney cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them the crowd swayed and parted, and there appeared, lifted by
      many arms, a figure with a dead-white face streaked with blood, running
      from a great gash in the scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went down in front of my horse," explained the Hochwald secretary
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight, there rose from the crowd a wailing cry, quite different
      from its former voice. Galpy's teeth set and his cricket bat went up in
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be killing for this," he said. "I know these blightehs. That
      yell means blood. We must make a bolt for it. Is this all there is of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of his asking, it was. One half a second later, it wasn't,
      as the last of the legation's stubborn bars yielded, the door burst open,
      and the four Americans tumbled out at the charge, Cluff yelling insanely,
      Carroll in deadly quiet, Sherwen alertly scanning the adversaries for
      identifiable faces, and Elder Brewster still imperiling his soul by the
      fervor of his language. Each was armed with such casual weapons as he had
      been able to catch up. Carroll, a leap in advance of the rest, encountered
      an Indian drover, half-dodged a swinging blow from his whip, and sent him
      down with a broken shoulder from a chop with a baseball club that he had
      found in the hallway. A bull-like charge had carried Cluff deep among the
      Caracunans, where he encountered a huge peon, whom he seized and flung
      bodily over the iron guard of a samon tree, where the man hung, yelling
      dismally. Two other peons, who had seized the athlete around the knees,
      were all but brained by a stoneware gin bottle in the hands of Sherwen.
      Meanwhile, Mr. Brewster was performing prodigies with a niblick which he
      had extracted, at full run, from a bag opportunely resting against the
      hat-rack. Almost before they knew it, the rescue party had broken the
      intercepting wing of the mob, and had joined the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cluff threw a gorilla-like arm across the Unspeakable Perk's shoulder,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurt, boy?" he cried anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm all right. Who's left with Miss Brewster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody. We must get back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherwen's cool voice cut in:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close together, now. Keep well up. Herr von Plaanden, will you cover us
      at the end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the post of honor," said the Hochwaldian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've earned it. But for you, they'd have got our colors."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner bowed, and swung his horse toward a Caracunan who had
      pressed forward a little too near. But, for the moment the fight had oozed
      out of the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without mishap the group got across the street, Perkins still clinging to
      the flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, from the rear rank, came a shower of stones, followed by the
      final rush. Galpy and Perkins went down. Von Plaanden tottered in his
      saddle, but quickly recovered. Instantly Perkins was up again, the blood
      streaming from the side of his head. He was conscious of brown hands
      clutching at the cricketer, to drag him away. He himself seized the
      cockney's legs and braced for that absurd and deadly tug of war. Then Von
      Plaanden's saber descended, and he was able to haul Galpy back into
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was desperate now. Mr. Brewster was pinned against the wall
      and disarmed, but still fighting with fist and foot. Half a dozen peons
      were struggling with Cluff across the bodies of as many more whom he had
      knocked down. Sherwen, almost under the cavalryman's mount, was protecting
      his rear with the fallen Galpy's cricket bat, and the two other cricketers
      were fighting back to back on the other side. Carroll was clubbing his way
      toward Mr. Brewster, but his weapon was now in his left hand. Matters
      looked dark indeed, when there shrilled fiercely from above them the
      whirring peal of a silver whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly Brewster had remembered Raimonda. It seemed a futile signal, for as
      she ran to the railing and gazed across at the Club Amicitia, she saw all
      its windows and doors tight closed, as befits an aristocratic club that
      has no concern with the affairs of the rabble. But there is no way of
      closing a patio from the top, and sounds can enter readily that way, when
      all other apertures are shut. Long and loud Miss Polly blew the signal on
      the silver hunting-whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the club patio, Raimonda was chafing and wondering, and a score of his
      friends were drinking and waiting. That signal released their activities
      and terminated the battle of the American Legation most ingloriously for
      the forces of Urgante. For the gilded youth of Caracuna bears a heavy cane
      of fashion, and carries a ready revolver, also, although not so admittedly
      as a matter of fashion. Furthermore, he has a profound contempt for the
      peon class; a contempt extending to life and limb. Therefore, when some
      two dozen young patricians sallied abruptly forth with their canes, and
      the mob caught sight, here and there, of a glint of nickel against the
      black, it gave back promptly. Some desultory stones rattled against the
      walls. There were answering reports a few, and sundry yells of pain. The
      army of Urgante broke and fled down the side streets, leaving behind its
      broken and its wounded. Most of the bullet casualties were below the knee.
      The Caracunan aristocrat always fires low&mdash;the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly thereafter, Miss Polly Brewster appeared upon the balcony of the
      American Legation, and performed an illegal act. Upon a day not designated
      as a Caracunan national holiday, she raised the flag of an alien nation
      and fixed it, and the gilded youth of Caracuna in the street below
      cheered, not the flag, which would have been unpatriotic, but the
      flag-raiser, which was but gallant, until they were hoarse and parched of
      throat.

    <h2>
      XI. &mdash; PRESTO CHANGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the battle, Miss Brewster reviewed her troops, and took stock of
      casualties, in the patio. None of the allied forces had come off
      scatheless. Galpy, whose injuries had at first seemed the most severe,
      responded to a stiff dose of brandy. A cut across the scientist's head had
      been hastily bandaged in a towel, giving him, as he observed, the
      appearance of a dissipated Hindu. To Von Plaanden's indignant disgust, his
      military splendor was seriously impaired by a huge "hickey" over his left
      eye, the memento of a well-aimed rock. Cluff had broken a finger and
      sprained his wrist. Mr. Brewster was anxious to know if any one had seen
      two teeth of his on the pavement or whether he was to look for later
      digestive indications of their whereabouts. Both of the young cricketers
      had been battered and bruised, though it was nothing, they gleefully
      averred, to what they had meted out. And Carroll had a nasty-looking
      knife-thrust in his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of them were disheveled, dilapidated, and grimy to the last degree,
      except the Hochwaldian, who still sat his horse, which he had ridden into
      the patio. But Miss Polly said to herself, with a thrill of pride, that no
      woman need wish a more gallant and devoted band of defenders. Leaning over
      them from the inner railing of the balcony, she surveyed them with
      sparkling eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was magnificent!" she cried. "Oh, I'm so proud of you all! I could hug
      you, every one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better come down from there, Polly," said her father anxiously. "Some of
      those ruffians might come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to-day," said Sherwen grimly. "They've had enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is correct," confirmed Von Plaanden. "Nevertheless, there may be
      disorder later. Would it not be better that you go to the British
      Legation, Fraulein?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I!" she returned. "I stay by my colors. And now I'm going to disband
      my army."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretching out her hand to a vase near her, she drew out a rose of deepest
      red and held it above Von Plaanden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The color of my country," said Von Plaanden gravely. "May I take it for a
      sign that I am forgiven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fully, freely, and gladly," said the girl. "You have put a debt upon us
      all that I&mdash;that we can never repay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I who pay. You will not think of me too hardly, for my one breach?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall think of you as a hero," said the girl impetuously. "And I shall
      never forget. Catch, O knight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rose fell, and was caught. Von Plaanden bowed low over it. Then he
      straightened to the military salute, and so rode out of the door and out
      of the girl's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men are strange creatures," mused the philosopher of twenty. "You think
      they are perfectly horrid, and suddenly they show their other side to you,
      and you think they are perfectly splendid. I wish I knew a little more
      about real people."
    </p>
    <p>
      She confessed to no more specific thought, but as she descended the stairs
      to bid farewell to the blushing and deprecatory Britons, she was eager to
      have it over with, and to come to speech with her beetle man, who had so
      strangely flamed into action. The Unspeakable Perk! As the name formed on
      her lips, she smiled tenderly. With sad lack of logic, she was ready to
      discard every suspicion of him that she had harbored, merely on the
      strength of his reckless outbreak of patriotism. She looked about the
      patio, but he was not there. Sherwen came out of a side door, his face
      puckered with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Mr. Perkins?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In there." He nodded back over his shoulder. "Your father is with him.
      Perhaps you'd better go in."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a chill at her heart, Polly entered the room, where Mr. Brewster bent
      a troubled face over a head swathed in reddened bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very crumpled and limp looked the Unspeakable Perk, bunched humpily upon
      the little sofa. His goggles had fallen off, and lay on the floor beside
      him, contriving somehow to look momentously solemn and important all by
      themselves. His face was turned half away, and, as Polly's gaze fell upon
      it, she felt again that queer catch at her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't know it was the same chap, would you?" whispered Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl picked up the grotesque spectacles, cradling them for an instant
      in her hands before she put them aside and leaned over the quiet form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Came staggering in, and just collapsed down there," continued her father
      huskily. "Lord, I wouldn't lose that boy after this for a million
      dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you talk that way?" she demanded sharply. "What has happened? Did
      he faint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just collapsed. When I tried to rouse him, he kicked me in the chest,"
      replied the magnate, with somber seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you goose of a dad!" There was a tremulous note in Polly's low
      laughter. "That's all right, then. Can't you see he's dead for sleep, poor
      beetle man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" said Mr. Brewster, vastly relieved. "Hadn't I better go
      out for a doctor, and make sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him rest. Hand me that pillow, please, dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      With soft little pushes and wedges she worked it under the scientist's
      head. "What a dreadful botch of bandaging! He looks so pale! I wonder if I
      couldn't get those cloths off. Lend me your knife, dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently as she worked, the head on the pillow began to sway, and the lips
      to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let me alone!" they muttered querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes opened. The Unspeakable Perk gazed up into the faces above him,
      but saw only one, a face whose tender concern softened it to a loveliness
      greater even than when he had last seen it. He tried to rise, but the
      hands that pressed him back were firm and quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie still!" bade their owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin film of color mounted to his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;beg your pardon," he stammered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;d-didn't
      know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a goose!" she adjured him. "It's only me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the trouble." He closed his eyes again, and began to murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he say?" asked Mr. Brewster, lowering his head and almost
      falling over backward as his astonished ears were greeted by the slowly
      intoned rhythm:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "Scarab, tarantula, doodle-bug, flea."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Delirious!" exclaimed the magnate. "Clean off his head! How does one find
      a doctor in this town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need, dad," his daughter reassured him. "It's just a&mdash;a sort of
      game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Game! Did you hear what he said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, a kind of password. It's all right, Dad. It is, really."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still undecided, Mr. Brewster stared at the injured man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;" he began, when the eyes opened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling better?" inquired Polly briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. The charm works perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything I can do, or get, for you, my boy?" inquired Mr. Brewster,
      stepping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in the ice-box?" asked the other anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried the girl in distress. "He's starving! When did you eat last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't exactly remember. It was about five this morning, I think. A
      banana, and, as I recall it, a small one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad!" cried the girl, but that prompt and efficient gentleman was already
      halfway to the cook, dragging Sherwen along as interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll get whatever there is in the shortest known time," the girl assured
      her patient. "Trust dad. Now, you lie back and let me fix up a fresh
      bandage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have made a great trained nurse," he murmured, as she adjusted the
      clean strips that Sherwen had sent in. "Don't pin my ear down. It's got to
      help hold my goggles on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dear funny goggles!" Picking them up, she patted them with dainty
      fingers, before setting them aside. He watched her uneasily, much in the
      manner of a dog whose bone has been taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind giving them back?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're not going to wear them here," she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got so used to them," he explained apologetically, "that I don't
      feel really dressed without them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed them back and he adjusted them to the bandages. "For the
      present, rest is prescribed you know," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" he declared. "As soon as I've had something to eat, I'll go.
      There are a hundred things to be done. Where are my gloves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What gloves? Oh, those white abominations? Why on earth do you wear
      them?" Her glance fell upon his right hand, which lay half-open beside
      him. "Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!" she cried in a rising scale of distress.
      "What have you done to your hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He reddened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, indeed! Tell me at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been rowing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, out to a ship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There aren't any ships, except the Dutch warship. Was it to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To carry our message&mdash;MY message?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He squirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm awfully sleepy," he protested. "It isn't fair to cross-examine a
      witness&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When was it?" his ruthless interrogator broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Night before last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell? Not far. A few miles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And back. And it took you all night," she accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if it did?" he cried peevishly. "A man's got to have some relief
      from work, hasn't he? It was livelier than sitting all night with one's
      eye glued to a microscope barrel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, beetle man, beetle man! I don't know about you at all. What kind of a
      strange queer creature are you? Have you wings, Mr. Beetle Man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she bent over and laid her soft lips upon the scarified palm. The
      Unspeakable Perk sat up, with a half-cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now the other one," said the girl. Her face was a mantle of rose-color,
      but her eyes shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't! You shan't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other one!" she commanded imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Miss Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A noise at the door saved him. There stood Thatcher Brewster, magnate,
      multi-millionaire, and master of men, a huge tray in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beefsteak, fried potatoes, alligator pear, fresh bread, REAL butter,
      coffee, AND cake," he proclaimed jovially. "Not to mention a cocktail,
      which I compounded with my own skilled hands. Are you ready, my boy? Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unspeakable Perk leaped from his couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Food!" he cried. "Real American food! The perfume of it is a square
      meal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're much gladder to see it than you were me," pouted Miss Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not half as afraid of it," he admitted. "Mr. Brewster, your health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's to you, my boy. Now I'll leave you with your nurse, and make my
      final arrangements. We're off by special in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fine!" said the scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Polly Brewster caught the turn of his head in her direction, and
      saw that his fork had slackened in his hand. Something tightened around
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went, her father considered her for a moment, and wondered. Never
      before had he seen such a look in her eyes as that which she had turned on
      the queer, vivid stranger so busily engaged at the tray. Polly, and this
      obscure scientist! After the kind of men whom the girl had known,
      enslaved, and eluded! Absurd! Yet if it were to be&mdash;Mr. Brewster
      reviewed the events of the afternoon&mdash;well, it might be worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Lord Harry, he's a MAN, anyway!" decided Thatcher Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the subject of his musings began to feel like a man once more,
      instead of like a lath. Having wrought havoc among the edibles, he rose
      with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could have one hour's sleep," he said mournfully, "I'd be fit as a
      cricket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall," said the girl. "Mr. Sherwen says he won't let you out of the
      house until it's dark. And that's fully an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to be on my way back now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back where? To your mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd be recognized and attacked before you could get out of the city. I
      won't let you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That wouldn't do, for a fact. Perhaps it would be safer to wait. I've
      made enough trouble for one day by my blunder-headed thoughtlessness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that what you call rescuing the flag?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, rescuing!" he said slightingly. "What difference does it make what
      vermin like that mob do? Just for a whim, to endanger all of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him in amaze and suspicion. But he was quite honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY whim," she reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I suppose it was," he admitted thoughtfully. "When I saw you crying,
      I lost my head, and acted like a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it was all my fault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't say that. Certainly not. I'm master of my own actions. If I
      hadn't wanted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it was my fault this much, anyway, that you wouldn't have done it
      except for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it was your fault to that extent," he said honestly. "I hope you
      don't mind my saying so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, beetle man, beetle man!" She leaned forward, her eyes deep-lit pools
      of mirth and mockery and some more occult feeling that he could not
      interpret. "Would it scare you quite out of your poor, queer wits if I
      were to HUG you? Don't call for help. I'm not really going to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you're not," said he dolefully. "But about that row, I want to set
      myself right. I'm no fool. I know it took a certain amount of nerve to go
      down there. And I was even proud of it, in a way. And when Von Plaanden
      turned and gave me the salute before he went away, I liked it quite a good
      deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he do that? I love him for it!" cried the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my point is this, that what I did wasn't sound common sense. Now if
      Carroll had done it, it would have been all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why for him and not for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because those are his principles. They're not mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you weren't quite so contemptuous of poor Fitz. It seems hardly
      fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contemptuous of him? I'd give half my life to be in his place after
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" There was a flutter in her throat as she put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he's going with you, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So are you, if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father won't go without you, I believe. Won't you come, if I ask you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Work, I suppose," said the girl; "the work that you love better than
      anything in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wrong there." His voice was not quite steady now. "But it's work
      that has to have my first consideration now. And there is one special
      responsibility that I can't evade, for the present, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And afterward?" She dared not look at him as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, afterward. There's too much 'perhaps' in the afterward down here. We
      science grubbers on the outposts enlist for the term of the war," he said,
      smiling wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I&mdash;can we go and leave you here?" she demanded obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, give me a square meal once in a while, and a night's rest here and
      there, and I'll do well enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear! I forgot your sleep. Here I've been chattering like a magpie.
      Take off your coat and lie down on that sofa at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall I find you when I wake up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right where you leave me when you fall asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! You mustn't wear yourself out watching over me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! You're under orders. Give me the coat." She hung it on the back of
      a chair. "Not another word now. And I'll call you when time is up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes, and the girl sat studying his face in the dim light,
      graving it deep on her inner vision, seeking to formulate some conception
      of the strange being so still and placid before her. How had she ever
      thought him ridiculous and uncouth? How had she ever dared to insult him
      by distrust? What did it matter what other men, estimating him by their
      own sordid standards, said of him? As if her thought had established a
      connection with his, he opened his eyes and sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew there was something I wanted to ask you," he said. "What did your
      'Never, never, never' mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A foolish misunderstanding that I'm ashamed of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it that&mdash;that woman-gossip business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I was stupid. Will you forgive me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there to forgive? Some time, perhaps, you'll understand the whole
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't let's say anything more about it. I do understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not quite true. All that Polly Brewster knew was that, with those
      clear gray eyes meeting hers, she would have believed his honor clean and
      high against the world. The presence of the woman, even that dress
      fluttering in the wind, was susceptible of a hundred simple explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's all right, then." There was relief in his tone. "Of course, in
      a place like this there is a lot of gossip and criticism. And when one
      runs counter to the general law&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Counter to the law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. As a rule, I'm not 'beyond the pale of law,'" he said, smiling. "But
      down here one isn't bound by the same conventions as at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's hand went to her throat in a piteous gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't understand. I don't want to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's got to be a certain broad-mindedness in these matters," he
      blundered on, with what seemed to her outraged senses an abominable
      jauntiness. "But the risk was small for me, and, of course, for her,
      anything was better than the other life. At that, I don't see how the
      truth reached you. What is it, Miss Polly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rage, grief, and shame choked the girl's utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, she ran from the room, leaving her companion a prey to
      troubled wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the patio, she turned sharply to avoid a group gathered around Galpy,
      who, with a patch over one eye, was trying to impart some news between
      gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got it from the bulletin board of La Liberdad," he cried. "Killed; body
      gone; devil to pay all over the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" demanded the Unspeakable Perk, running out, coatless and
      goggleless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's been another riot, and Dr. Luther Pruyn is killed," explained
      Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bulletin board&mdash;La Liberdad&mdash;just saw it," panted Galpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! It's a bola."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole city is ringing with it. They say it was a plot to get him out
      of the way to stop quarantine. The Foreign Office is buzzing with
      inquiries, and Puerto del Norte is burning up the wires."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Puerto del Norte! How did they hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Telephone, of course. I hear Wisner is coming up," said Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to get a wire to the port at once," cried the scientist. "At
      once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To stop off Wisner. To tell him it isn't so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're excited, my boy," said Mr. Brewster kindly. "Better lie down
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true, right enough," said the Englishman. "Sir Willet's cochero saw
      the mob get him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When? Where?" asked Fitzhugh Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't got any details, but the Government admits it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care if the President and his whole cabinet swear to it,"
      vociferated the Unspeakable Perk. "It's a fake. How can I get Puerto del
      Norte, Mr. Sherwen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't get it at all for any such purpose. How do you know it's a
      fake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I know? Oh, dammit! I'M Luther Pruyn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched off his glasses and faced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little group stood petrified. Mr. Brewster was first to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crazy, poor chap!" he said. "Luther Pruyn was my classmate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my father, Luther L."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proofs," said Sherwen sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my coat pocket. In the room. Can I have your wire, Mr. Sherwen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's cut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the railway wire," offered Galpy. "My eye! Wot a game!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men ran out, the scientist leaving behind coat and goggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was our little mix-up that started the rumor," said Carroll
      thoughtfully. "Somebody recognized Perk&mdash;Dr. Pruyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When his glasses fell off," said CLuff. "They're some disguise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's Luther Pruyn, sure enough!" said Mr. Sherwen, emerging from the
      room. "Here's the proof." He held out an official-looking document. "An
      order from the Dutch Naval Office, made out in his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it say?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not much of a hand at Dutch, but it seems to direct the blockading
      warship to receive Dr. Luther Pruyn and wife and convey them to Curacao."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And wife!" exclaimed Cluff loudly. He whistled as a vent to his
      amazement. "That explains all the talk about a woman&mdash;a lady in his
      quinta on the mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently," said Carroll. "May I see that document, Mr. Sherwen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The American representative handed him the paper. As he was studying it,
      Galpy reentered, still scant of breath from excitement and haste. "He's
      gone back to the mountains," he announced. "Sent word for you to get to
      the port before dawn, if you have to walk. See Mr. Wisner there. He'll
      arrange everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Mr. Perk&mdash;Dr. Pruyn be there?" asked Mr. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he's gone without his coat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And goggles," said Cluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And his pass," added Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust him to come back for them when he gets ready. He's a rum josser for
      doing things his own way. Now, about the train." And Galpy outlined the
      plan of departure to the men, who, except Carroll, had gathered about him.
      The Southerner, unnoticed, had slipped into the room where the scientist's
      coat lay. Coming out by the lower door, he was intercepted by Miss Polly
      Brewster. He interpreted the misery in her face, and turned sick at heart
      with the pain of what it told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "Is it true? Did you see the permit yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Here it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to see it. It doesn't matter," she said, with utter
      weariness in her voice. "When do we leave? I want to go home. Send father
      to me, please, Fitz."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brewster came to her, bearing the news that the sailing was set for
      the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad to know that Dr. and Mrs. Pruyn are provided for," she remarked,
      so casually that the troubled father drew a breath of relief, concluding
      that he must have misinterpreted the girl's interest in the man behind the
      goggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way to the patio, he passed through the room where the scientist
      had lain. He came out looking perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has any one been in that room just now?" he asked Sherwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I've seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The coat and the other things are not there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inquiry and search alike proved unavailing. Not until an hour later did
      they discover that Carroll had also disappeared. Sherwen found a note from
      him on the office desk:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Please look after my luggage. Will join the others at the yacht to-morrow.

      XII. &mdash; THE WOMAN AT THE QUINTA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thanks to his rival's map, Carroll had little difficulty in finding the
      trail to the mountain quinta. A brilliant new moon helped to make easy the
      ascent. What course he would pursue upon his arrival he had not clearly
      defined to himself. That would depend largely upon the attitude of the man
      he was seeking. The flame of battle, still hot from the afternoon's melee,
      burned high in the Southerner's soul, for he was not of those whose spirit
      rapidly cools. Bitter resentment on behalf of Miss Polly Brewster fanned
      that flame. On one point he was determined: neither he nor the so-called
      Perkins should leave the mountain until he had had from the latter's own
      lips a full explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out into the open space, he got his first glimpse of the quinta. It
      was dark, except for one low light. From the farther side there came
      faintly to his ear a rhythmical sound, with brief intervals of quiet, as
      if some one hard at labor were stopping from time to time for breath. At
      that distance, Carroll could not interpret the sound, but some
      unidentified quality of it struck chill upon his fancy. Long experience in
      the woods had made him a good trailsman. He proceeded cautiously until he
      reached the edge of the clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound had stopped now, but he thought he could hear heavy breathing
      from beyond the house. As he moved toward that side, a small but
      malevolent-looking snake slithered out from beneath a bush near by.
      Involuntarily he leaped aside. As he landed, a round pebble slipped under
      his foot. He flung up his arm. It met the low branch of a tree, and saved
      him a fall. But the thrashing of the leaves made a startling noise in the
      moonlit stillness. The snake went on about its business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hola!" challenged a voice around the angle of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll recognized the voice. He stepped out of the shadows and strode
      across the open space. At the corner of the house he met the muzzle of a
      revolver pointing straight at the pit of his stomach. Back of it were the
      steady and now goggleless eyes of Luther Pruyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am unarmed," said Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it's you!" said the other. He lowered his weapon, carefully whirled
      the cylinder to bring the hammer opposite an empty chamber, and dropped it
      in his pocket. "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so," said the other coolly. "I'd forgotten that I invited you here.
      How long had you been watching me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you only when you came out from behind the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you wish to know about&mdash;about my companion in this place?"
      continued the other in an odd tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Understand that I don't admit that you have the smallest right. But to
      clear up a situation which no longer exists, I'm ready to satisfy you.
      Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held open the door of the room where the lone light was burning. In the
      middle of the floor was spread a sheet, beneath which a form was outlined
      in grisly significance. Carroll's host lifted the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was white-haired, frail, and wrinkled. One side of her face
      shone in the lamplight with a strange hue, like tarnished silver. In her
      throat was a small bluish wound; opposite it a gaping hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shot!" exclaimed Carroll. "Who did it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some high-minded Caracunan patriot, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I suspect that it was a mistake. From a distance and inside a
      window, she might easily have been taken for some one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll's mind reverted to his companion's ready revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yourself, for instance?" he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was left in the Southerner's manner no trace of the cross-examiner.
      Suspicion had departed from him at the first sight of that old and still
      face, leaving only sympathy and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been running a private hospital up here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. I took her because there was no other place fit for her to go to.
      And I had to keep her presence secret, because there's a law against
      harboring lepers here. A pretty cruel brute of a law it is, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leprosy!" exclaimed Carroll, looking at that strange silvery face with a
      shudder. "Isn't it fearfully contagious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in any ordinary sense. I was trying a new serum on her, and had
      planned to smuggle her across to Curacao, when this ended it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curacao? Then that pass for yourself and wife&mdash;By the way, that and
      your coat are over in the thicket, where I dropped them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. But it doesn't say 'wife.' It says simply 'a woman.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you were encumbering yourself with an unknown leper, at a time like
      this, just as an act of human kindness?" There was something almost
      reverential in Carroll's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scientific interest, in part. Besides, she wasn't wholly unknown. She's a
      sort of cousin of Raimonda's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll's mind flew back to his fatally misinterpreted conversation with
      the young Caracunan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he mean by letting me think that you shouldn't associate with
      Miss Polly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he had the usual erroneous dread of leprosy contagion, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask you another question, Mr. Per&mdash;I beg your pardon, Dr.
      Pruyn?" said the visitor, almost timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins will do." The other smiled wanly. "Ask me anything you want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you run away that day on the tram-car?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To avoid trouble, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? Why, you go about searching for dangerous and difficult jobs. That
      won't do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. It's only when I can't get away from them. But I couldn't
      risk arrest then. Some one would surely have recognized me as Luther
      Pruyn. You see, I've been here before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I don't see why they didn't identify you, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three years ago I was much heavier, and wore a full beard. Then these
      glasses, besides being invaluable for protection, are a pretty thorough
      disguise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they are. But the game is up now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes." The scientist drew the sheet back over the dead woman. "I suppose
      the sharp-shooters who did the job will report me safely out of the way.
      It's only a question of when the burial party will come for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, why are we waiting?" cried Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't leave her lying here," replied the other simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of rhythmical labor came back to Carroll's memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were digging her grave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. Carroll, stiffly, for his knifed arm was painful, got
      out of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's an extra spade?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their labor was over, and the leper laid beneath the leveled soil,
      Carroll cut two branches from a near-by tree, trimmed them, bound them in
      the form of a cross, and fixed the symbol firmly in the earth at the dead
      woman's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was well thought of," said the scientist. "I'm afraid that wouldn't
      have occurred to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can get word to Senor Raimonda?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host nodded. A long silence followed. Carroll broke it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there is no further secrecy about this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her identity." He pointed to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I suppose not. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Miss Brewster has a right to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you propose to tell her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," agreed the scientist, after a pause for consideration. "But
      not until after the yacht is at sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll did not reply directly to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out, if I can. I'm ordered to Curacao. Wisner left word for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come down the mountain with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible. There are matters here to be attended to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then when will you come down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before you sail. I must be sure that you get off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll come to the yacht, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you should. There are reasons why&mdash;why&mdash;Miss Brewster&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a question that I can argue," the other cut him off. "I can't do
      it." There was so much pain in his voice that Carroll forbore to press
      him. "But I'll ask you to take a note."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carroll nodded, and his host, disappearing within the quinta, returned
      almost at once with an envelope on which the address was written in
      pencil. The Southerner took it and rose from the porch, where he had flung
      himself to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perkins," he said, with some effort, "I've thought and said some hard
      things about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally enough," murmured the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me to apologize?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientist stared. "Do you want me to thank you for to-night's work?"
      he countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men, different in every quality except that of essential manhood,
      smiled at each other with a profound mutual understanding. There was a
      silent handshake, and Carroll set off down the mountain toward the sunrise
      glow.

    <h2>
      XIII. &mdash; LEFT BEHIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dawn crested, poised, and broke in a surf of splendor upon the great
      mountain-line that overhangs Puerto del Norte. Where, at the corporation
      dock, there had lurked the shadow of a yacht, gray-black against
      blue-black, there now swung a fairy ship of purest silver, cradled upon a
      swaying mirror. Tiny insects, touched to life by the radiance, scuttled
      busily about her decks and swarmed out upon the dock. The seagoing yacht
      Polly had awakened early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the mule path that forms the shortest cut from the railway station
      straggled a group of minute creatures. To one watching from the
      mountain-side with powerful field-glasses&mdash;such as, for example, a
      convinced and ardent hater of the Caribbean Sea, curled up with his back
      against a cold and Voiceless rock&mdash;it might have appeared that the
      group was carrying an unusual quantity of hand luggage. Yet they were not
      porters; so much, even at a great distance, their apparel proclaimed. The
      pirates of porterdom do not get up to meet five-o'clock-in-the-morning
      specials in Caracuna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little group gathered close at the pier, then separated, two going
      aboard, and the others disappearing into sundry streets and reappearing
      presently at the water-front with other figures. The human form cannot be
      distinctly seen, at a distance of three miles, to rub its eyes; neither
      can it be heard to curse; but there was that in the newer figures which
      suggested a sudden and reluctant surrender of sleeping privileges. Had our
      supposititious watcher possessed an intimate and contemptuous knowledge of
      Caracuna officialdom, he would have surmised that lavish sums of money had
      been employed to stir the port and customs officials to such untimely
      activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not money or any other agency is potent to stir Caracunan officialdom
      to undue speed. Hence the observer from the heights, supposing that he had
      a personal interest in the proceedings, might have assured himself of
      ample time to reach the coast before the formalities could be completed
      and the ship put forth to sea. Had he presently humped himself to his feet
      with a sluggish effort, abandoned his field-glasses in favor of a pair of
      large greenish-brown goggles, and set out on a trail straight down the
      mountains, staggering a bit at the start, a second supposititious observer
      of the first supposititious observer&mdash;if such cumulative hypothesis
      be permissible&mdash;might have divined that the first supposititious
      observer was the Unspeakable Perk, going about other people's business
      when he ought to have been in bed. And so, not to keep any reader in
      unendurable suspense, it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Unspeakable Perk was making his way down the dim and narrow
      trail, another equally weary figure shambled out from the main road upon
      the flats and made for the landing. The apparel of Mr. Preston Fairfax
      Fitzhugh Carroll was in a condition that he would have deemed quite unfit
      for one of his station, had he been in a frame of mind to consider such
      matters at all. He was not. Affairs vastly more weighty and human occupied
      his mind. What he most wished was to find Miss Polly Brewster and unburden
      himself of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance to the pier, he was detained by the American Consul. Cluff
      came running down the long structure in great strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moses, Carroll! I'm glad to see you! Where've you been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A week earlier, the scion of all the Virginias would have resented this
      familiarity from a professional athlete. But neither Mr. Carroll's mind
      nor his heart was a sealed inclosure. He had learned much in the last few
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up on the mountain," he said. "For Heaven's sake, give me a drink,
      Cluff!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other produced a flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do look shot to pieces," he commented. "Find Perk&mdash;Pruyn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I'll tell you later. Where's Miss Brewster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In her stateroom. Asleep, I guess. Said she wanted rest, and nobody was
      to disturb her till we sail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do we start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight o'clock, they say. That means ten. Will Dr. Pruyn get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't going with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no. I forgot his Dutch permit. Well, he'd better use it quick, or
      he'll go in a box when he does go. I wouldn't insure his life for a
      two-cent stamp in this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't if you'd seen what I saw last night," said the Southerner,
      very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wisner, the busy, efficient little consul, who had been arranging with the
      officials for Carroll's embarkation, now returned, bringing with him a
      viking of a man whom he introduced as Dr. Stark, of the United States
      Public Health Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either of you know anything about Dr. Pruyn?" he inquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's on his way down the mountain now," said Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! He's ordered away, I'm glad to say. Just got the message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then perhaps he will go out with us," said Cluff, with obvious relief. "I
      sure did hate to think of leaving that boy here, with the game laws for
      goggle-eyed Americans entirely suspended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. He's ordered to Curacao to stay and watch. We've got to get him out
      to the Dutch ship somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't the yacht take him and transfer him outside?" asked Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Carroll," said Dr. Stark earnestly, "before this yacht is many
      minutes out from the dock, you'll see a yellow flag go up from the end of
      the corporation pier. After that, if the yacht turns aside or comes back
      for a package that some one has left, or does anything but hold the
      straightest course on the compass for the blue and open sea&mdash;well,
      she'll be about the foolishest craft that ever ploughed salt water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so," admitted Carroll. "Well, I have matters to look after on
      board."
    </p>
    <p>
      Into Mr. Carroll's cabin it is nobody's business to follow him. A man has
      a right to some privacy of room and of mind, and if the Southerner's
      struggle with himself was severe, at least it was of brief duration.
      Within half an hour, he was knocking at Polly Brewster's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "PLEASE go 'way, whoever it is," answered a pathetically weary voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Polly, it's Fitzhugh. I have a note for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it in the saloon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's important that you see it right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From whom is it?" queried the spent voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Dr. Pruyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I don't want to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must!" insisted her suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he say I must?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I say you must. Forgive me, Miss Polly, but I'm going to wait here
      till you say you'll read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Push it under the door," said the girl resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed. Polly took the envelope, summoned up all her spirit, and opened
      it. It contained one penciled line and the signature:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-bye. All my heart goes with you forever. L. P.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something fluttered from the envelope to her feet. She stooped and picked
      it up. It was the tiniest and most delicate of orchids, purple, with a
      glow of gold at its heart. To her inflamed pride, it seemed the final
      insult that he should send such a message and such a reminder, without a
      word of explanation or plea for pardon. Pardon she never would have
      granted, but at least he might have had the grace of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you read it?" asked the patient voice from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. There is no answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Pruyn said there wouldn't be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why are you waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Fitz, I'm too worn out, and I've a splitting headache. Won't it
      wait?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." The voice was gently inflexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More messages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; something I must tell you. Will you come out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was utterly listless and limp. Utterly listless and limp, she
      looked, too, as she opened the door and stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Polly, it's about the woman at Perkins's&mdash;at Dr. Pruyn's
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dilated with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't hear! How dare you come to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must! Don't make it harder for me than it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, startled, and noted the haggard lines in his face.

    <p>
      "I'll hear it if you think I should, Fitz."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead? His&mdash;his wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wasn't his wife. She was a helpless leper, whom he was trying to cure
      with some new serum. He had to do it secretly because there is a law
      forbidding any one to harbor a leper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Fitz!" she cried. "And she died of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. They killed her. Last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They? Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Government agents, probably. They were after Pruyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How horrible! And&mdash;and Mrs. Pruyn. Where was she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't any Mrs. Pruyn. There never was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Dutch permit! It was for Dr. Pruyn and his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sherwen misread the form. So did I. It read for Dr. Pruyn and a woman. He
      hoped to take her to Curacao and complete his experiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what he meant when he spoke of being lawless, and I've been
      thinking the basest things of him for it!" The girl, dazed by a flash of
      complete enlightenment, caught at Carroll's arm with beseeching hands.
      "Where is he, Fitz?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On his way down the mountain. Perhaps down here by now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's coming to the ship?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he doesn't expect to see you again. He was coming down to make sure
      that we got off safely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fitz, dear Fitz, I must see him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Polly," he said miserably, "I'll do anything I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, poor Fitz!" she cried pityingly, her eyes filling with tears. "I wish
      for your sake it wasn't so. And you have been so splendid about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've tried to make amends, and play fair. It hasn't been easy. Shall I go
      back and look for him? It's a small town, and I can find him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I'll write a note. No; I won't. Never mind. I'll manage it. Fitz, go
      and rest. You're worn out," she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back into her stateroom went Miss Polly. From that time forth no man saw
      her nor woman, either, except perhaps her maid, and maids are dark and
      discreet persons on occasion. If this particular one kept her own counsel
      when she saw a trim but tremulous figure drop lightly over the starboard
      rail of the Polly far forward, pick up a small traveling-bag from the
      pier, step behind the opportune screen of a load of coffee on a flat car,
      and reappear to view only as a momentary swish of skirt far away at the
      shore end; if this same maid told Mr. Thatcher Brewster, half an hour
      later, that Miss Polly was asleep in her stateroom, and begged that she be
      disturbed on no account, as she was utterly worn out, who shall blame her
      for her silence on the one occasion or her speech on the other? She was
      but obeying, albeit with tearful misgivings, duly constituted authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight o'clock struck on the bell of the little Protestant mission church
      on the tiny plaza; struck and was welcomed by the echoes, and passed along
      to eventual silence. Within two minutes after, there was a special stir
      and movement on the pier, a corresponding stir and movement on board the
      trim craft, a swishing of great ropes, and a tooting of whistles. White
      foam churned astern of her. A comic-supplement-looking pelican on a buoy
      off to port flapped her a fantastic farewell. The blockade-defying yacht
      Polly was off for blue waters and the freedom of the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the shore, feeling woefully helpless and alone, she who had been the
      jewel and joy of the Polly bit her lips and closed her eyes, in a
      tremulous struggle against the dismal fear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose he doesn't love me, after all!"
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIV. &mdash; THE YELLOW FLAG
    </h2>
    <p>
      The departing whistle of the yacht Polly struck sharply to the heart of a
      desolate figure seated on a bench in the blazing, dusty, public square of
      Puerto del Norte, waiting out his first day of pain. A kiskadee bird, the
      only other creature foolish enough to risk the hot bleakness of the plaza
      at that hour, flitted into a dust-coated palm, inspected him, put a
      tentative query or two, decided that he was of no possible interest, and
      left the Unspeakable Perk to his own cogitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So deep in wretchedness were the cogitations that he did not hear the
      light, hesitant footstep. But he felt in every vein and fiber the
      appealing touch on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God! What are YOU doing here?" he cried, leaping to his feet. There
      was no awkwardness or shyness in his speech now; only wonder-stricken joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came back to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the yacht! Your ship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! She mustn't! Not without you! You can't stay here. It's too
      dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must. They think I'm aboard. I left a note for papa. He won't get it
      until they're at sea. And they can't come back for me, can they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;yes&mdash;they must! I must see Stark and Wisner at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To send me away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without forgiving me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgiving? There's no question of that between you and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is. Fitzhugh told me everything&mdash;all about the poor dead
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he shouldn't have done that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should!" She stamped a little willful foot. "What else could he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes," he agreed thoughtfully. "I suppose that's so. After all, a man
      can't bear the names that Carroll does and go wrong on the big inner
      things. He has met his test, and stood it. For he cares very deeply for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Fitz!" she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But here we're wasting time!" he cried in a panic. "Where can I leave
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want to leave me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to!" he groaned. "Can't you understand that I've got to get you to
      the yacht!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, beetle man, beetle man, don't you WANT me?" she cried dolorously.
      "Didn't you mean your note?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mean it? I meant it as I've never meant anything in the world. But you&mdash;what
      do you mean? Do you mean that you'll&mdash;you'll let the yacht go without
      you&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and stay here, and m-m-marry me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you should ask me," she said, half-laughing, half-crying, "what else
      could I do? I'm alone and deserted. And there's only you in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss P-P-Polly," he began, "I&mdash;I can't believe&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true!" she cried, and held out two yearning hands to him. "And if
      you stammer and stutter and&mdash;and&mdash;and act like the Unspeakable
      Perk NOW, I'll&mdash;I'll howl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had any such project, the chance was lost on the instant of the
      warning, as he caught her to him and held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she cried, trying to push him away. "Do you know, sir, that this is
      a public square?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I didn't choose it," he reminded her, laughing in pure joy, with a
      boyish note new to her ear. "Anyway, there are only us two under the sun."
      And he drew her close again, whispering in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;oh, is that the language of medical science?" she reproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, generic curiosity overcame the feathered eavesdropper in
      the tree above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qu'est-ce qu'il dit?"&mdash;"What's he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned a flushed and adorable face upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't tell you. It's for me alone," she declared joyously. "But you'll
      never stop saying it, will you, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, as long as we both shall live. And that reminds me," he said
      soberly. "We must arrange about being married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that reminds you, does it?" she mocked. "Just incidentally, like
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! Boom! Boom! The mission clock kept patiently at it until its
      suggestion struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!" he cried. "Mr. Lake, the missionary, will marry us. And we'll
      have Stark and Wisner for witnesses. How long does it take a bride to get
      ready? Would half an hour be enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather a short engagement," she remarked demurely. "But if it's all
      the time we've got&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. But, darling, we'll have to ride for it afterward, and get across
      to the mainland. I've no right to let you in for such a risk," he cried
      remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't help yourself," she teased saucily. "I ran you down like one
      of your own beetles. Besides, what does that permit for the Dutch ship
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's for myself and a woman&mdash;the leper woman. Not for myself and
      my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm a woman, aren't I? And it doesn't say that the woman MUSTN'T be
      your wife." She blushed distractingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caesar! Of course it doesn't! What luck! We'll be in Curacao to-morrow. I
      must see Wisner about getting us off. But, Polly, dearest one, you're
      sure? You haven't let yourself be carried away by that foolishness of mine
      yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure? Oh, beetle man!" She put her hands on his shoulders and bent to his
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sulphur-colored winged Paul Pry stuck an impertinent head out from
      behind a palm leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit? Qu'est-ce qu'elle dit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second and last time in his adult life the beetle man threw a
      stone at a bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four hours later six powerful black oarsmen rowed a boat containing two
      passengers and practically no luggage out across the huge lazy swells of
      the Caribbean toward a smudge of black smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!" cried that one of the passengers who wore huge goggles. "There
      goes the flag!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A square of yellow bunting slid slowly up the pierhead staff of the dock
      corporation, and spread in the light shore breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the modern flaming sword," he continued. "The color stirs
      something inside me. Ugly, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is ugly," she confessed thoughtfully. "Yet it's the flag we fight
      under, too, isn't it? And we'd fight for it if we had to, just as we
      fought for the other&mdash;our own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love your 'we,'" he laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nestled closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you still hating the Caribbean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? I'm loving it the second-best thing in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I loved it first," she reminded him jealously. "Dearest," she added,
      with one of her swift swoops of thought, "what was that funny title the
      British Secretary of Legation had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Oh, Captain the Honorable Carey Knowles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Well, I shall have a much nicer, more picturesque title than that
      when we come back to Caracuna&mdash;dear, dirty, dangerous, queer,
      riotous, plague-stricken old Caracuna!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then my liege ladylove intends to come back?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Some time. And in Caracuna I shall insist on being Mrs. the
      Unspeakable Perk."
    </p>
    <p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
